<h3>How To Select A Credible Plumber Logansport IN</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your structure needs a backflow preventer or multiple gadgets, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are granted in incredibly unusual cases where the structure is deemed to not position a risk to the water system, must be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, as well as an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
