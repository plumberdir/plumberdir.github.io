<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components might have very tight tolerances that need to be maintained. A crucial thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is a very crucial part of the style of each part. If the part is not repaired effectively, the guide could limit the motion (instead of constant or direct) of the element, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities.

Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
