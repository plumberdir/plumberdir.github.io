<h3>How To Keep A Blocked Toilet From Becoming A Plumbing Catastrophe at Spencer WV 25276</h3>
<p>Water temperature problems can be fixed by adjusting the temperature level on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be caused by a blocked aerator screen. Homeowners can merely loosen the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can also be low.</p>
