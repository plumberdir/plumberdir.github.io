When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is likewise worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals.
