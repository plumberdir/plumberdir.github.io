<p>Backpressure may occur when the drinkable supply piping is linked to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not effectively safeguarded, potable and non-potable water or liquids can be pushed into the safe and clean supply system.</p>
<p>A range of pipe products are used for entire house repiping, including PEX and copper pipe. The cost varies, depending upon the kind of material and size of your home. We more than happy to supply estimates for whole home pipe replacement and funding options are available for large tasks. A pressure vacuum breaker performs the very same function as an atmospheric vacuum breaker, but requires only one system to protect the entire water supply when mounted on the main water line.</p>
<p>The Delaware Division of Public Health Plumbing Authorization and Inspection Program has workplaces in Kent and Sussex Counties.
