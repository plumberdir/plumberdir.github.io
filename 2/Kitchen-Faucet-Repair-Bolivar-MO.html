<p>Carefully lift the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no modification screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's adjusted properly (Photo 8). You don't need to clear the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>We focus on repair, service and installation of all makes and models of gas hot water heater, electric hot water heater and tankless water heaters. Carefully bend the float arm to put extra pressure on the toilet valve. (To change a float that does not have an arm, see Image 8.) Then flush the toilet to see if it works. Running toilets can be the result of a rusty overflow pipe, worn flush valve assembly, or broken flapper valve. Give the specialists at Wingate a call to repair your running toilet and reduce wasted water.</p>
