<p>A backflow preventer stops water inside your water pipes from flowing back to the City system if pressure is lost. Backflow can infect the water supply. The standard mechanism for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow prevention device, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. All leakages, worn fittings, and other plumbing problems will be solved.</p>
<p>Because of the intrinsic design of a lowered pressure backflow assembly, fluctuating supply pressure on an exceptionally low flow or static circulation condition might cause nuisance leaking and prospective fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve immediately ahead of the RPZ will typically hold the pressure consistent to the assembly in times of varying supply pressure.</p>
