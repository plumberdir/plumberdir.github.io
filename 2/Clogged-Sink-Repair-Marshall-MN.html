As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable amount, there should be no issue in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you ought to most likely not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop blocking is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils.
