Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself.

If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
