<p>Renovation plumbers usually charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend much more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey price going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
<p>Backflow preventers not conforming to these rules for a provided application and which are worn or broken and require replacement must be changed by a backflow preventer which does comply to the rules for the given application.
