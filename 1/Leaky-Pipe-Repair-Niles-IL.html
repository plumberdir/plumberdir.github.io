<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
