<p>The program accomplishes its mission by providing for the adoption and promulgation of suitable rules and policies for the building of plumbing facilities where mandated. Cold showers? High energy bills? It might be time for a brand-new hot water heater. However in order to profit of a brand-new energy-efficient device, you'll need to have it set up appropriately. A water heater that is not set up correctly can result in water damage, scalding temperature levels, and even a fire. That's why installation is best delegated professional plumbers who understand the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this accreditation. I have actually talked to a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the price to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
