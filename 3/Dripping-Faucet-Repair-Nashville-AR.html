<p>Buy a borax replacement water softer in the EU and it's enormously likely you will be buying a box of salt sesquicarbonate - Na2CO3.NaHCO3.2 WATER. Salt sesquicarbonate is a hydrated crystal made up from salt carbonate and sodium bicarbonate and is really typically found in bath salts.

<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is normally the culprit. However not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper.

Picture 3 shows how to set the slack ideal.</p>

<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
