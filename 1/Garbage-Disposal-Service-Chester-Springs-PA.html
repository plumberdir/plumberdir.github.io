<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water became basic. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This corrosion, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Introduced more than a decade earlier, Uponor ProPEX fittings stay the surest method for making watertight Uponor PEX-a connections quick and easy. Capitalizing on the unique, thermal shape memory of Uponor's PEX-a tubing, fittings in fact get more powerful with time.
