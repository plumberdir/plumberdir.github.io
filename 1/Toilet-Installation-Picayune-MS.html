<p>If you have actually constantly resided in an area with hard water, you might not recognize just how much it impacts you-- however if you have actually just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too aware of the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from hard water. Hard water hinders the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, causing you to use more. Tough water also makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that tough water causes your skin to flake, itch, and redden typically.</p>

<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features 2 fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
