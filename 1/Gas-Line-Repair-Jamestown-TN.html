<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and expensive plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 years of age Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. Because of the age of the home and area of the pipe, it was a hard job. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
