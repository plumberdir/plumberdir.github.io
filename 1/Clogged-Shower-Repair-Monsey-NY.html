<p>Installed 50 gallon electric hot water heater and thermal growth tank. When your drains are clogged, you will most likely begin to notice gurgling noises, water backing up into your sink or shower, or strange smells.

<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and then go back to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt due to the fact that they regrow whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, usually regenerate after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. Such designs are convenient if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
