<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and costly plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a clog or can cause rust that blocks the line.
