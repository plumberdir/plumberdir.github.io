<p>The pipe-bursting approach is used on pipes that are badly harmed, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for repairing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes two four foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe.

The pipe is a plastic material that will be impervious to root invasion for approximately 100 years.</p>
