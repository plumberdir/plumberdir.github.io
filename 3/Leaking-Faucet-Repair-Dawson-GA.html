<h3>Clogged Sink Repair  in Dawson Georgia</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will suggest a full repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>
