<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Cedar Rapids IA</h3>
<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually typically been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due largely to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment.

The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not requirement. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>

<p>While fixing your hot water heater is typically the less expensive choice to make, it isn't constantly the best one depending on your situation.
