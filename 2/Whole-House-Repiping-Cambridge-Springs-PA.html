These systems typically are installed in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars.

If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

Your hot water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leaks are among the most common indications that your unit is at completion of its lifespan, especially if they are causing major flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>
