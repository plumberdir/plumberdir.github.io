<p>When you eliminate the cap to flush out the valve, examine the washer for wear or cracks. Changing a bad washer is simple and low-cost. But discovering the right washer may not be. The most common washers are frequently available in the house centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be tough to discover. Eliminate it and take it to the store to find a match if you decide to hunt for a washer. Plumbers normally replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
