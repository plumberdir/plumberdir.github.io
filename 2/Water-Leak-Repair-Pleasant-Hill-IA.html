If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener doesn't tip over and remove the plumbing. You need to wait till after the cycle is finished and then inspected the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regrowth.

A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
<p>The secret to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a sensible quantity, there should be no problem in getting most of the waste through.

Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation.
