Water pressure may be or fail decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water system (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe might permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
