<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed.

The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
