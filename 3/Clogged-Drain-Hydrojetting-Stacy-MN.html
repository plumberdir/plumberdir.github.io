<p>If you think your toilet has a leak, the good news is that it does not necessarily require a repair of your whole unit. A toilet's tank is made up of several little moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or fixed due to their regular use. When these parts wear out, they result in small leaks that are tough to see with the naked eye. This is why it is essential to call a plumber as quickly as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet waste water, it can also cause flooding and water damage.</p>
