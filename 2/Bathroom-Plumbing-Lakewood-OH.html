<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Lakewood OH</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
