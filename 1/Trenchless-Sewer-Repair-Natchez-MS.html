<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system.

Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
