<p>During sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates technician inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your residential or commercial property. The camera is manually manipulated on a flexible rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light provides a clear image for the specialist to properly examine conditions and detect the functionality of the pipes. The information we obtain from the inspection allows us to make an informed decision regarding the condition of your pipes and advise the best option too. We can make the perfect suggestion with confidence if the pipe needs to be cleaned up of obstructions or relined with epoxy resin.</p>

<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in locations where the ambient temperature is preserved at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is triggered by heat from a fire, water flows right away from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In scenarios where there is a need to offer sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small loading dock, an antifreeze system can be used. The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high threat security assembly.</p>
