Chances are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger may not be enough to resolve this concern. Call a plumber instantly.</p>

<p>If you are looking to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has actually begun to leak, very first consider your options. A complete sewer pipe replacement might not be necessary. Often, relining your existing pipes is a better choice. If your sewer lines are beneath trees, near substantial landscaping, walkways, driveways or other semi-permanent functions, overall sewer excavation can cause a great deal of civilian casualties (and expense) to the surrounding area.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: spray a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, examine to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually changed color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
