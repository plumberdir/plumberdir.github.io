<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and intricate plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole home repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 years of age Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. Since of the age of the home and place of the pipe, it was a tough job. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am really grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
