If, state, you need a new burner kit and the hot water heater is five years old, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more uncertain the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
