<p>The trick to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a sensible amount, there must be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you ought to most likely not put into the waste disposal unit though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop obstructing is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
