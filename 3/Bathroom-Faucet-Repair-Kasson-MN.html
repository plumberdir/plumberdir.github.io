The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no chance to supply one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
