<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
