<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Comstock Park MI</h3>
<p>These men were incredible! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had great evaluations and a fair cost, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job tidying up after it also.</p>
<p>It's a great concept to schedule yearly inspections if your plumbing system is years old and if you know that you have a history of leaking or clogging. Test. Contact a third-party Backflow Tester from our Authorized Tester List to check the backflow assembly. The tester will submit the outcomes to us. If you need a garbage disposal replacement, be sure to find a plumber you trust who will finish the job right at an affordable cost.</p>
