<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully lift the rod and listen. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Bend the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make certain it's changed effectively (Picture 8). You don't have to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
