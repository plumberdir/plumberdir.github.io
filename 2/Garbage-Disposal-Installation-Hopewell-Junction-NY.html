<p>The best source for this kind of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you do not get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor understands the indications of quality work that you might miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, appropriately sized holes in studs, joists, and floorings. Finally, a quality contractor will not threat dealing with an inferior plumber. A basic error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly ravage $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and make complex the task with insurance coverage claims, lost time, and claims. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the very best.</p>
