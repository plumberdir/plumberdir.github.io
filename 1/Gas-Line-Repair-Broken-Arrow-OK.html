<p>Agilent's series of leak detection solutions guarantee the safety, security and constant efficiency of research, vacuum, and commercial process systems. Examining the water meter is a great next action in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and examine.

The information we glean from the inspection allows us to make an informed choice regarding the condition of your pipes and suggest the very best option also. We can make the perfect recommendation with confidence if the pipe needs to be cleaned up of blockages or relined with epoxy resin.</p>
