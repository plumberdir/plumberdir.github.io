<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a feasible option, specifically when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of disadvantages to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they typically contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the risk of harm to your house and family.</p>
