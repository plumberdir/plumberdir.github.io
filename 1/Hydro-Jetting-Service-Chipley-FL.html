<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
