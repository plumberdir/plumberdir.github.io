<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply.

Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
