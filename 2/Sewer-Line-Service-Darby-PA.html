<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is an individual choice. Water softener systems work by getting rid of solidity minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to hinder the scale from developing by neutralizing the solidity itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are often thought about a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively eliminate firmness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
