You have long-term water hardness if you don't see limescale accumulation but rather see soap residue, your washing cleaning agents not working as efficiently or your skin getting delicate and scratchy. Do not try to locate the leak if you smell gas. Rather, leave the house or building right now. Do not turn on or off any electrical switches, home appliances, or lights, as an electrical charge might produce a spark. Call the Peoples emergency hotline when you are in a safe place.</p>
<p>Setting up a salt-based softener or water softener alternative offers better, more secure drinking water.
