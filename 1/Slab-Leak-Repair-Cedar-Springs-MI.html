The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.

It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
