It is essential to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a properly operating RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in areas based on water damage. Sufficient drainage should also be provided.</p>
