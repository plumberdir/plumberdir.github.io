<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the standard structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to detect.</p>
<p>No warm water-- The absence of hot water is the most significant indication that there is something incorrect with your San Antonio water heater. You might have sediment that has actually built up in the system and separated the water from the heat source if you aren't getting adequate hot water for your shower. If your water heater isn't doing its only job, it's time to speak with the professionals.</p>
