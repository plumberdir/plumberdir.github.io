<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater in West Roxbury MA 02132</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
