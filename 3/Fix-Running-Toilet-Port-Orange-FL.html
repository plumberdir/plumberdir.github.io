<p>A. Using phosphoric acid usually will help eliminate them if you have rust areas. If you wish to try the gentlest technique perhaps try using some Coke on the rust initially.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola includes a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Clean with a soft cloth and after that more Coke, over and over, and so on. Then use Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to read the directions and security warnings first!), if that doesn't do the trick.

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
