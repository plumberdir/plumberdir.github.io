<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is essential that the repair professional knows the correct installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. A lot of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
<p>Gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is used for heating our homes, for lightening our stoves, and for running appliances such as water heaters. This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially referred to as marsh gas or overload gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that occurs in the earth's crust and is also in some cases formed by the decomposing of raw materials like sewage or manure. As helpful as this gas is, the features that make this gas dangerous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer. However, to prevent off that threat, mercaptans are added into natural gas, which gives it a rotten egg smell and makes it detectable when leaking. Make sure to only rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
