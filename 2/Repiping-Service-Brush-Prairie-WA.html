<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components might have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An essential thing to recognize on each element is the guide.

If the part is not repaired appropriately, the guide could restrict the motion (instead of consistent or direct) of the component, which might trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
