<p>Backflow is the undesirable reversal of circulation of water which might bring unclean water or other, hazardous substances into the public supply of water and personal plumbing. Backflow can happen in a variety of situations that may draw water from locations such as garden water fountains, pool, or sprinkler system systems into City water supply lines. Backflow can likewise carry water into your plumbing if it is connected to any outdoors water source. One example would be a garden hose linked to an external faucet with completion left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
<p>If you notice low water pressure or discolored water, it normally symbolizes rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals develop in time, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you may observe lower water pressure. The staining takes place when rust becomes loose from the pipes and flow into your water system, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can become a health danger in your water.</p>
