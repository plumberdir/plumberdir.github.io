<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Lincoln Park MI</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
