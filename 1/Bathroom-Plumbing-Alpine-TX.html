<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk circumstances is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
