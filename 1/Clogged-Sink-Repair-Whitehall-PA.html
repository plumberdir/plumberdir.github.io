<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
