It is necessary to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger a correctly working RPZ assembly to regularly discharge small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in areas based on water damage.

<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the sodium exchange websites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
