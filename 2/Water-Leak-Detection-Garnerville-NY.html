<p>The program accomplishes its mission by providing for the adoption and promulgation of suitable guidelines and regulations for the building of plumbing centers where mandated. Cold showers? High energy bills? It might be time for a new warm water heater. But in order to reap the benefits of a new energy-efficient device, you'll need to have it installed properly. A water heater that is not set up properly can result in water damage, scalding temperature levels, and even a fire. That's why installation is best left to professional plumbers who understand the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>Newer models, such as tankless hot water heater, are far more energy-efficient and can help you minimize your regular monthly utility bills.
