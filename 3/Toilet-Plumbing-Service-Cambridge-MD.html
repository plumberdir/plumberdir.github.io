<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they need to be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>When a gas line is ruptured, it immediately becomes a serious security danger. Without being repaired as quickly as possible, it might trigger a fair bit of damage if the natural gas inside becomes sparked. The first concern is to turn off the supply of natural gas and call the utility company if an individual realizes that they have burst a gas line.</p>
