<h3>Looking For A Plumber In Lynden WA</h3>

It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company since they had great evaluations and a fair rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it too.</p>
