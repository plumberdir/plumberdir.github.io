In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future.
