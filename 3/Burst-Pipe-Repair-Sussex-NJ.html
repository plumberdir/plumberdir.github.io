<p>Toilet repair is one of the most common plumbing repairs performed in homes today. This is most likely due to the reality that there are anywhere from 300 to 350 million toilets in the U.S. alone. Due to the vast variety of toilets, we have repaired numerous toilets in homes throughout the Tampa area so we are very familiar with the products used and how they are installed here locally. We also have done numerous toilet replacements too; this is generally called for when either a resident chooses to replace their toilet with perhaps a more effective one or when a toilet is simply beyond repair.</p>
<p>1. Install a lint-catcher: Your washing machine's water line is accountable for bringing the water out of the machine after it's done washing.

It's so old that it is no longer able to push water through the toilet to totally clear the drain. This results in your toilet having a constant blocking issue.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the perpetrator. However not constantly. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper.

<p>You live in an older house. There's a good chance that you'll need to have it done soon if your house is 50 years old or older and you've never ever replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were usually installed in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are known to rust and burst when they get old. You may need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't already have one if so. This normally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
