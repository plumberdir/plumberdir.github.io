<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to detect.</p>
