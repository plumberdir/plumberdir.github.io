<p>A general rule is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy.

<h3>How To Choose An Exceptional Plumbing Service Matteson IL</h3>
<p>Contrary to what many believe, having a waste disposal unit in fact secures your pipes and extends their lifespan. Food washed down a drain accidentally or on purpose without a disposal can get stuck in pipe turns, causing clogs and slowly damaging your plumbing system. Tiny food particles created by a garbage disposal wash straight down easily.</p>
<p>Was your house built prior to the 1970s and has not undergone renovation or pipe replacement? It is most likely that your pipes are made of galvanized metal or another product which has actually worn away and rotted over the years if so. Older pipes can cause major leakages and even pollute your water as they decay. Even the highest quality pipes will not last permanently and will need to be changed.</p>
