Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
