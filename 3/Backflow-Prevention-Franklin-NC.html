<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step process. Step, cut, and link the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, procedure and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape.
