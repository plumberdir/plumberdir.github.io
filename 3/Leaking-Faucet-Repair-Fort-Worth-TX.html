<p>Purchasing a home is a huge investment. Knowing if you have galvanized pipes, copper drain pipes, lead closet bends, or an inferior piping system can be convenient when working out the sale of a home. There are a lot of types of piping systems and conditions, it's a great concept to get an entire house plumbing inspection in addition to a water heater and sewer camera inspection.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above techniques do not work, the next action would be to get rid of the P-trap under the sink.

Nowadays, a lot of kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
