<p>Very first consider your options if you are looking to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has started to leak. A complete sewer pipe replacement might not be essential.

The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.

When a trained tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
