Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.

<p>Backpressure might take place when the drinkable supply piping is linked to a system or fixture which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping. Greater pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be required into the potable supply system if these connections are not properly secured.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of flow in a potable water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only stream in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always flow toward the point of most affordable pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help combat a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The demand upstream could trigger a reversal in circulation.</p>
