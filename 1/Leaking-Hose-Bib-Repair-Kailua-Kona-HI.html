<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Many homeowners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to solve their filthy or clogged drain problems. These chemicals are simple to utilize and economical, but they harm your pipes and their effects are just short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners utilize harsh chemicals to eat away at the clog and with repeated usage, these chemicals will likewise eat away at the pipe producing vulnerable points that are vulnerable to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always suggested.</p>
