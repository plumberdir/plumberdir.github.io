<p>E.R. Services understands the importance of maintaining the integrity and performance of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a positive charge. Salt, the mineral that water softeners utilize to replace hardness ions, likewise has a favorable charge, so none of these ions are brought in to each other.

<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Columbia Falls MT 59912</h3>
