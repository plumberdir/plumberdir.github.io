Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
