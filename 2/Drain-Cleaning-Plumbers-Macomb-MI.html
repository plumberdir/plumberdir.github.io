It's also useful because, at the same time, the plumber can expect the drains and recommend any drain repair, or drain cleaning service. In some cases whatever is blocking the drain will not budge. If you have actually attempted to unclog a bathroom or kitchen sink without any luck, it may be time to call a professional plumber.

If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make certain it's adjusted properly (Picture 8). You do not need to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>

Sometimes, the design or number will be on the underside of the cover or inside the tank. Matching an unusual flapper can become a trial-and-error procedure. Even professional plumbers sometimes attempt 2 or three flappers prior to they find one that works well.</p>
