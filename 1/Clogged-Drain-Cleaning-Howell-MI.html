<p>Aside from these 2 crucial parts, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less vital things that can break or weaken. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled.

We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
