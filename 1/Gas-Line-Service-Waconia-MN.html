<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
