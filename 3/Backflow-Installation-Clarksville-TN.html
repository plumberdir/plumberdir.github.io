When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals.
