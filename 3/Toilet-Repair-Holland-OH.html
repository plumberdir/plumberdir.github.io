<p>The U-shaped pipe underneath bathroom and kitchen sinks is something that people anticipate to see however rarely stop to consider. Energy Performance. Selecting a tank with at least 1.5 inches of foam insulation and an Energy Star ranking is suggested. The energy effectiveness of a storage water heater is suggested by its Energy Element (EF).
