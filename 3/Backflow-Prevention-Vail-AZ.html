<p>In water circulation systems, water is normally maintained at a considerable pressure to enable water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might stop working or be lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe might allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Without a plumbing camera inspection, most drain problems can just be discovered once they begin to back up. However, throughout routing plumbing inspections, a complete test of all drains will be performed.

Professional drain cleaning with cleanouts is a lot more reliable at removing blockages. Many homes have drain cleanouts, however, we come across older houses without cleanouts.
