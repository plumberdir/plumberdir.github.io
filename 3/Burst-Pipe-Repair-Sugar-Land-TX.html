<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
