<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however likewise has a third check valve that is really a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
