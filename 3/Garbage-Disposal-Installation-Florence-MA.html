<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is really a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
