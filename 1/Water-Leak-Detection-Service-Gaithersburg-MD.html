The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it does not grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck.

<p>Plumbing is a vital part of your house or service, and its ability to function is necessary. If you experience frequent problems with your plumbing, like drains blocking, this could be a sign of a larger issue, like a tree root intrusion or a large clog. If the drains clog sometimes but you can generally flush them out, this may be a smaller clog like a buildup of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap scum from the bathroom. Small obstructions can become big ones fairly quickly.</p>
