<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, that makes its plumbing's effective working a necessity more than a need. As soon as the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process.

Once the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to guarantee no valves were accidentally left open or did not close properly when re-pressurized.
