Most of toilets are standard sized - implying a "will fit" seat is sufficient for safety and convenience. Some toilets, however, have actually uniquely formed bowls and need a particular seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It truly isn't a good concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to little, unless they have actually been particularly developed to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to move around, or will not disperse your weight equally and could ultimately trigger fractures in the bowl.</p>
