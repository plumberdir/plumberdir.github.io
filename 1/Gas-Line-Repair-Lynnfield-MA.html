Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
