First, plans for each device to be installed must be prepared by a RA or PE, and an application for approval sent to the DEP, which may take up to 3 weeks or more to process and authorize. Turned down strategies need to be modified and resubmitted to the DEP approval queue, which can add another several weeks to the timeline.</p>
<p>The pipe-bursting method is used on pipes that are seriously harmed, for replacing a whole pipe system, or for repairing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, which includes two 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers start by placing a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe.
