It has two spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
