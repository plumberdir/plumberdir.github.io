<p>The trick to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a reasonable quantity, there should be no issue in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food products you need to most likely not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are finished cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>
