<p>Carefully lift the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Bend the float arm if there is no change screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's changed effectively (Photo 8). You don't have to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is a sign the tank is failing and will need to be changed.
