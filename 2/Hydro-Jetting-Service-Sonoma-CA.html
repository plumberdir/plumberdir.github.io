<p>Replacing your sink is a detailed process. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Before attaching any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are utilizing copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it might need extra adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>

The factors for this can range from leakages, malfunctioning or faulty electrical circuitry, or a broken heating component or thermostat. If it is among the mentioned problems, a repair or replacement of the parts may be adequate. However, if the water heater system has all of these problems occurring regularly, then a water heater replacement is needed.</p>
