<p>Sewer linings can help to repair broken pipes without having to entirely replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Many house owners prevent repiping their houses since it is a big task that is often viewed as an unneeded expense. Why repipe your home when fixing it is possible? Well, the truth is that repiping is more cost-effective and efficient in a lot of cases. At Epic Plumbing, we provide property owners with individualized, cost-effective repiping options in Pearland and beyond.</p>
<p>Check Valves and Dual Checks. There are 2 other types of backflow preventers readily available that you may face. The first is a check valve. The second is a double check". It is NOT the exact same thing as a Check although it might be marketed as one! Do not get swindled! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Double Checks have losses similar to Check (5 PSI).</p>
