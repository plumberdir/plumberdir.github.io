If it bubbles, you likely have a gas leak and need to immediately contact a gas plumber to perform an emergency gas line repair.</p>
<p>When used in combating a fire, fire department connections can be a concern. Firefighters by and large are not concerned with backflow prevention issues. They are worrying about securing people's lives and to a lesser level their residential or commercial property. Getting the necessary volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will use water from any source readily available to attain that objective.

<p>Handheld sprayer. Leakages can in some cases establish on the water lines for handheld sprayers that are connected to the kitchen sink. If the leak is far enough down the water line, water will drip into the cabinet below.
