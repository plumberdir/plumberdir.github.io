<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In Dixon CA</h3>
<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has typically been misunderstood as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mainly to overstated advertising and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening just removes hardness minerals and gets rid of problems that are a problem and not a threat to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not necessity. Nevertheless, water softening does have benefits, and drawbacks, that make this decision a significant one.</p>
