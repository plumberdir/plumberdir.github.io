If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed.

We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>
