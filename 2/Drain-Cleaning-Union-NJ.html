<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and intricate plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause an obstruction or can trigger corrosion that obstructs the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Sound-- Over time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets difficult and takes away from the capacity of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
