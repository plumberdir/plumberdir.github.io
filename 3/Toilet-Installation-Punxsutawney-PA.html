<p>If you notice low water pressure or tarnished water, it typically represents rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals develop in time, they constrict the circulation of the water which is why you may observe lower water pressure. The discoloration happens when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and circulation into your supply of water, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can become a health hazard in your water.</p>
