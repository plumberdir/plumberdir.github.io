Which is why selecting a comfortable, reliable toilet seat is very crucial. However, you need to ensure your toilet seat actually fits your toilet. The majority of toilets are basic sized - suggesting a "will fit" seat suffices for security and convenience. Some toilets, however, have distinctively shaped bowls and require a particular seat, like the Eljer Emblem.
