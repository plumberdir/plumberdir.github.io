<p>Also called a garbage disposer, a garbage disposal is available in two standard types - constant feed, which typically has a wall-mounted switch so the system keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover be in place to operate the system. Constant feed is common and the easiest to utilize; a batch feed design is safer but can be slower to use on big quantities of food waste due to the fact that you need to process it in batches.
