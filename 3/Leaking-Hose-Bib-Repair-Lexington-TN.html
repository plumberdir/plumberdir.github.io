<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were constructed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
