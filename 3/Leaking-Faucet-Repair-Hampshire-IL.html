<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is really a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk situations is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
