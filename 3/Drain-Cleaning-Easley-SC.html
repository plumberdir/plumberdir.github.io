<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>

<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully listen and lift the rod. You might be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no change screw, flex the float arm.
