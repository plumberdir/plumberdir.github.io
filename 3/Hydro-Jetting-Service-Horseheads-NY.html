<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were developed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water became standard. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>

<p>Tank to Tank installation: Usually, replacing a gas or electrical water tank with a comparable model takes two to three hours. It takes in between 45 to 60 minutes to drain, disconnect and remove your old water heater.

<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however likewise has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is since if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
