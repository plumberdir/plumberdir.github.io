<h3>Plumber Work Scope And Its Specialization House Springs MO</h3>
<p>Split sewer pipes can be more than simply a costly repair-- they can lead to costly and extensive home damage and lead to serious health threats. Sewer line repair is the first line of defense when a sewer line stops working. Sewer line replacement is the only other option if the sewer line can't be fixed. Fortunately, Mr. Rooter ® Plumbing is your local source for quality sewer repair and replacement at any time.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as tough water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
