The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin.

<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
