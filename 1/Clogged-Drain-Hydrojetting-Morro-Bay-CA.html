<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will rust.

The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
