<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Shafter CA</h3>
<p>The most reliable method to deal with hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>You hear water running or leaking in the tank. A backflow occurs when water runs backwards through your pipes and into the drinking water system.
