<h3>How To Choose An Exceptional Plumbing Service Martin TN</h3>
<p>The most effective way to deal with hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
