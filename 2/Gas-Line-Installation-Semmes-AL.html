It has 2 spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.
