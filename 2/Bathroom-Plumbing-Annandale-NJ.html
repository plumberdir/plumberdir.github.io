<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is very important that the repair professional knows the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work since the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
<p>When pipes are arranged into a vertical kind it is described as a hydrostatic loop. In this setup the loop should be greater than 33 feet to operate properly. When developed by doing this it prevents siphoning and backflow into a water system.
