These products collect in the drain and ultimately harden versus the pipe walls, making them challenging to get rid of. Your water heater is leaking: Water heater leaks are among the most common signs that your system is at the end of its life-span, particularly if they are triggering significant flooding or are coming from the tank itself.</p>
