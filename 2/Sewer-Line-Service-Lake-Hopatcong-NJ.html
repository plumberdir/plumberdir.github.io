<p>No warm water-- The absence of hot water is the most significant sign that there is something incorrect with your San Antonio hot water heater.

<p>Some makers declare that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
