<p>Manual leak detection for drainage applications is the easiest of the 3 readily available techniques. Tankless units last 5-10 years longer than tanked units and require less repairs gradually. Sanford & Kid plumbing provides sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding locations.
