<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with property owners in the area. He noted that there are certain contaminants that locals are dealing with and an RO can help reduce those problems. Due to being mainly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of agricultural waste. Rinckey noted that these systems get rid of around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally occurs in some soils which too can be fixed with the ideal RO system.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends on the extent of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
