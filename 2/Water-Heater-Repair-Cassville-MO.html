Certain pipe materials have higher coefficients of heat pressure, making them more susceptible to structural stresses and stress as a result of temperature change and ice formation. And these distinctions dictate the possible need for backflow preventers.</p>
<p>The types of backflow preventers the company supplies consist of check valve assemblies, double check detector assemblies (including stainless-steel models), and reduced pressure zone assemblies.
