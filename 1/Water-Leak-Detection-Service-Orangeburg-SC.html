Over a period of time the within lining of the pipe will degrade and a small pinhole leak will establish.

Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an alternative to consider if you live in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for lots of years, however steel ultimately struggles with deterioration and lacks the sturdiness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
