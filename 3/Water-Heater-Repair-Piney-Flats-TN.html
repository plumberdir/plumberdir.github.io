<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by eliminating hardness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the firmness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener alternative in areas where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not successfully get rid of hardness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
