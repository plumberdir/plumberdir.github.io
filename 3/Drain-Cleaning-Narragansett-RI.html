I chose this company due to the fact that they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task tidying up after it as well.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>With PVC you have a number of options if your pipe is stopping working; one is to repair the bad connection that is triggering an interruption. The other is to proceed and replace the entire line. If the line is about 40 years of ages and is showing indications of age throughout, definitely replace. Nowadays, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based on the condition of the line, it might be an appropriate alternative to do simply that. However, if the offset worsens trenchless might no longer be a choice.</p>
