If the element is not repaired properly, the guide might limit the motion (rather than constant or direct) of the component, which could trigger the part to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
