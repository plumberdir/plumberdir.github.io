Potable and non-potable water or liquids can be required into the potable supply system if these connections are not effectively protected.</p>
<p>This is an elbow-shaped device bent at a 90 degree angle. There is a valve on the inside of it that avoids water backflow. The system is based upon pressure and needs to be installed at least 6 inches of where the downstream will be. It can be placed on PVC pipes, but is not testable.
