<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is actually a vent available to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
