Plumbing Codes and State law dictate minimum standards for backflow prevention. Public water supply such as the City Utilities Department should satisfy or exceed the state requirements and bring the obligation for enforcing them.</p>
<p>The source or area of a sewer problem determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (generally 10 feet wide) where main sewers traverse private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
