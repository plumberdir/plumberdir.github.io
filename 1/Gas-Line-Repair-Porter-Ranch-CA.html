The city or Uruk includes the earliest recognized examples of brick built Latrines, built atop interconnecting fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later on used in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had quickly removable and exchangeable segments, and enabled cleaning.</p>

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or rust can end up being a health threat in your water.</p>
<p>Backpressure occurs when the pressure in a personal water system goes beyond the pressure in the general public water circulation lines that can cause normal circulation to reverse.
