It is very important that the repair technician understands the appropriate installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
