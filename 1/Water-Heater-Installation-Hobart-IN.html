<p>Hydro jetting is among numerous trenchless services available to you, available via North Georgia Inliner. Hydro jetting is the use of hot, extremely pressurized water through a protected hose and nozzle to clear any and all blockages. This process is somewhat more eco-friendly than snaking given that it just utilizes water, which your pipes are used to handling. Because a 2nd inspection isn't needed, it also saves you cash and time.</p>
<p>We concentrate on repair, service and installation of all makes and designs of gas water heaters, electric hot water heater and tankless water heaters. Carefully flex the float arm to put extra pressure on the toilet valve. (To change a float that doesn't have an arm, see Image 8.) Then flush the toilet to see if it works. Running toilets can be the result of a corroded overflow pipe, broken flush valve assembly, or broken flapper valve. Offer the specialists at Wingate a call to repair your running toilet and reduce lost water.</p>
