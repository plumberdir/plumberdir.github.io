<p>E.R. Services comprehends the significance of preserving the integrity and efficiency of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge. Salt, the mineral that water softeners utilize to replace hardness ions, likewise has a positive charge, so none of these ions are attracted to each other. Nevertheless, salt's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't drawn in to each other, how can an exchange take place?

<p>Your old discharge tube probably will not be the best length for your new disposal.

To avoid this, make sure the brand-new waste disposal unit installation package includes a tube, or purchase one independently at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
