<h3>Blocked Drains in Newburyport MA 01950 - Various Tools Used</h3>

<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>

<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a practical solution, particularly when simple plunging does not appear to work.

These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, however at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your house and household.</p>
