Generally, they start small and go undetected, and after time can result in large puddles underneath your sink and cabinetry. This type results in possible water damage. A lot of other kinds of leaky kitchen sinks which are frustrating but are generally repaired quickly.

<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently listen and lift the rod. If the water turns off, you might be able to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no change screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's adjusted correctly (Photo 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not need to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
