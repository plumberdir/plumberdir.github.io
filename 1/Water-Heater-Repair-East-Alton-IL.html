<h3>Drain Plumbing in East Alton Illinois</h2>
<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed successful, Sam Blanc developed and constructed a smaller sized design that ran on the exact same concept but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also developed a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and community sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable. It was ceased in 1973.</p>
