<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and elaborate plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping. Current Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 years of age Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. It was a hard job due to the fact that of the age of the house and place of the pipe. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left.
