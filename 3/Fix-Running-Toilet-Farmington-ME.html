<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Promises? Water circulates in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly concentrated saltwater option (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>
<p>CareSoft Elite ® is a top-of-the-line water softener, geared up with a high-performance resin that easily decreases the most difficult of minerals. With a patented chlorine generator, our exceptional systems also offer an automated cleaning cycle. The CARIX ® ion exchange process (CArbon Dioxide Regenerated Ion EXchanger) permits a purposeful partial desalination and therefore softening of drinking water containing high amounts of hardeners, nitrate and sulfate.</p>
