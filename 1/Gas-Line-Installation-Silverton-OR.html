<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages.

If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

<p>Without a plumbing camera inspection, a lot of drain concerns can only be detected once they start to back up. But, throughout routing plumbing inspections, a complete test of all drains will be carried out.
