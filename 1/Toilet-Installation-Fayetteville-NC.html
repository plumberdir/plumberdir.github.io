<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Fayetteville NC</h3>
<p>These guys were fantastic! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it too.</p>
