The size of the pipes must be proportional to the size of the home appliance being installed.</p>
<p>Is your home 50+ years of ages? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the main product used in plumbing. While galvanized steel is strong, it generally succumbs to corrosion after about 50 years and requires replacement. Even more modern pipes will not last permanently, so watch on plumbing systems that might be reaching the end of their lifespan.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
