<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to get this accreditation. I've consulted a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would expect the cost to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

Just after responding to the following questions ought to you answer repair or replace. Do you understand how many years old your water heater is? Do you know how many years it's rated for? If it is close to the number of years the hot water heater was ranked for, think about replacement instead of repair.</p>
<p>The proper repair of a backflow preventer requires many products to be assessed. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly must be examined. The installation needs to be evaluated to ensure it does not circumvent the functions of the assembly. Test information need to be built up to determine the workings of each component.

A correctly repaired assembly should offer years of security.</p>
