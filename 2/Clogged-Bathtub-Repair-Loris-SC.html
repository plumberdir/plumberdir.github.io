The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
