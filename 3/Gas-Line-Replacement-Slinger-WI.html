<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
