<p>If you have an older home, there's a likelihood you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they start to rust. This corrosion can lead to a buildup of lead, which can have many negative effects on your health. Rusty pipes also cause poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
