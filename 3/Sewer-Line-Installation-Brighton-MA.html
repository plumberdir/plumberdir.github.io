<p>Food scraps compose up to 20% of all household waste. This large quantity of trash does not need to enter the trash bin if it can easily and quickly be disposed of through the sink. A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into tiny pieces that are capable of traveling through the sewage pipes without hindering water circulation. By setting up a garbage disposal you are helping the environment by conserving the amount of garbage that gets sent to land fills and other discarding areas.
