<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to prevent winter freezing.
