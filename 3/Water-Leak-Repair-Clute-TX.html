<h3>Septic System Installation in Clute Texas</h2>
<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds an extremely focused option of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually contributed to the salt water tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is lessening, the heavy salt water option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
