<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is a remarkably pure form of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>For plumbing work other that repair or replacement fixtures, a building permit is normally required before a plumbing authorization can be released. Soften only what you need to. People typically choose to soften showers, sinks, and laundry hookups. Toilets, hose bibs, basement sinks, and other cold water taps normally do not need to be connected to a softener. In many cases, individuals choose to soften only the warm water.</p>
