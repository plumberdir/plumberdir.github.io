In this approach, water is treated with a calculated quantity of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their particular carbonates which get sped up.</p>
<p>Your storm drains do not go straight into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is usually carried somewhere else to a neighboring treatment plant, a creek, or even the ocean in. Through the storm drain system there are long, flat sections of pipe that can be prone to clogging due to the fact that there simply isn't enough a high sufficient flow to flush out the particles.</p>
