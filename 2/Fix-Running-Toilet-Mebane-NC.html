<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when searching for a practical option, especially when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous disadvantages to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they usually include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, however at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your home and family.</p>
