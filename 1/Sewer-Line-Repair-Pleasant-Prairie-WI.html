<p>The usual solution is to have the faulty pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to consider if you live in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for numerous decades, however steel eventually suffers from corrosion and does not have the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
