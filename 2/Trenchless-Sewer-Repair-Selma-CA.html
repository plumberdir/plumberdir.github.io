<p>The best way to deal with high city water pressure according to the city of San Diego utilities website is by setting up a pressure minimizing valve (PRV). A PRV will control water pressure as it enters into the home. According to San Diego utilities, a PRV can also assist to save water as fixtures in the home will utilize less water when the pressure is at a lower and more workable PSI.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
