<h3>Water Pipes Repair in Annville Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Water softening utilizes a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the tough water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is total. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>Hard water is any supply of water that contains excess minerals or metals, such as calcium and magnesium.
