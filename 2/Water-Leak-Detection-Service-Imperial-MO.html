Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become breakable.

Utilizing the images recorded by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as clogs, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>The goals of a great local plumbing system are to supply a building with a safe drinking-water supply and a system for the elimination of liquid waste. The system must operate within the specifications of standards and codes that are intended to guarantee the quality and performance of plumbing systems and to secure the health of the structure residents as well as the health of the general public in basic.</p>
