It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk circumstances is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.
