<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk situations is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>

<p>The Mesopotamians presented the world to clay sewer pipes around 4000 BCE, with the earliest examples discovered in the Temple of Bel at Nippur and at Eshnunna, 7 used to get rid of wastewater from sites, and capture rainwater, in wells. The city or Uruk consists of the earliest recognized examples of brick built Latrines, constructed atop adjoining fired clay sewer pipes, c. 3200 BCE. 8 9 Clay pipes were later utilized in the Hittite city of Hattusa 10 They had quickly detachable and replaceable segments, and allowed for cleaning.</p>

<p>Re-piping is a process of changing the supply of water pipes in a house or structure. It is a total replacement of your supply plumbing system. Repiping is a procedure of setting up a new water line plumbing system. This process generally includes getting rid of old readily available pipes and then installing the new plumbing system.

<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
