Foods like rice and pasta can swell when mixed with water, and potentially trigger a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can likewise trigger clogs and jams - consider composting or positioning these products in the garbage. Furthermore, grease and oil can harden and collect in your drain too.

<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>Water softeners will run to drain during backwash and quick rinse anywhere from 2 to 4 GPM (depending upon the size of the unit). Each cycle will discharge 25 to 50 gallons of water with high levels of solidity minerals and chloride that you might not desire simply running outside. Not to discuss plumbing code may be breached without appropriate backflow prevention.</p>
