Sometimes the service is to repair the damaged area of pipe, and an area repair is all that is necessary to solve the issue. Other times a more substantial service is required: repiping.</p>
<p>Set out the brand-new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I've been to many carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having gone through the softener. Generally, this is because the system is dated or not working correctly. Whatever the reason, you can be losing out on the benefits of soft water without even knowing it.</p>
