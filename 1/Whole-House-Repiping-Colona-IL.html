<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>

These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your house and family.</p>
