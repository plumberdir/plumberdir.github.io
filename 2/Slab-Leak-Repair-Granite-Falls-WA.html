As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a sensible quantity, there ought to be no issue in getting most of the waste through.

Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on.
