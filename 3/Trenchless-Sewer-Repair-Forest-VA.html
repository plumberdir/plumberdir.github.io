<p>Inside the house, check the kitchen faucets and bathroom faucets for drips or leakages. Inspect beneath sinks to look for leaking pipes. Local plumber estimated rate of $400 to install plus cost of waste disposal unit. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ pleased I inspected around. Under the sink, put a bucket or pan below the drain, then use locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to detach the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's drain. To loosen up the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>

Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
