<h3>Plumbing And Remodeling Services Grand Prairie TX</h3>

Understanding when to repair versus when to replace can get confusing since modern-day toilets include numerous elements.

<p>Water softeners typically have a life-span of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are appropriately kept. Making certain the salt water tank never runs out of salt will extend the unit's life.  Protecting the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also safeguard the unit. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange efficiency. Resin cleaners boost the regeneration cycle and help alleviate the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
