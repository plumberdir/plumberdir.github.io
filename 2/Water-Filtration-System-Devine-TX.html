These systems usually are installed in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars.

<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
