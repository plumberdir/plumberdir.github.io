<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Lots of homeowners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to resolve their dirty or clogged drain problems. These chemicals are easy to use and inexpensive, however they harm your pipes and their effects are just short-term.

This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is constantly advised.</p>
