<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk.

This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
