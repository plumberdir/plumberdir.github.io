You might smell the revolting smell of sewage before you feel the squish of your lawn under your feet (hopefully shoed feet!). A sinkhole can form, making it necessary to cordon off that portion of your yard. The scenario is filled with problems due to the fact that the swampiness will attract unwanted animals. Plumbers refer to a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Ideally, your Evanston plumber's contact number is on your speed dial.</p>
<p>There's a good opportunity you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This deterioration can lead to an accumulation of lead, which can have lots of unfavorable results on your health. Rusty pipes also result in bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
