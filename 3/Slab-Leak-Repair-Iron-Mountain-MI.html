Cold showers? High energy bills? It may be time for a brand-new warm water heater. But in order to profit of a new energy-efficient appliance, you'll need to have it set up appropriately.

That's why installation is best delegated professional plumbers who understand the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>If it slowly drains away as you work, include more hot water. Keep plunging up until the drain is clear or you decide it's time to try a new method.
