<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
