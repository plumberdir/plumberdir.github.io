<p>Old, used, or damaged plumbing pipes can trigger substantial problems. Even small leaks can gradually moisten walls and floors until they end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other allergens. Old galvanized iron pipes might become rusty and include rust to the water system. Gurgling noise from pipes.
