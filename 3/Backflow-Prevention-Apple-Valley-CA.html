Which is why picking a comfortable, well-made toilet seat is exceptionally crucial. Nevertheless, you need to make sure your toilet seat actually fits your toilet. The majority of toilets are standard sized - meaning a "will fit" seat is sufficient for safety and convenience. Some toilets, however, have actually uniquely shaped bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It actually isn't a great concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to little, unless they have been specifically created to fit typical toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to slide around, or won't distribute your weight evenly and could eventually trigger cracks in the bowl.</p>
