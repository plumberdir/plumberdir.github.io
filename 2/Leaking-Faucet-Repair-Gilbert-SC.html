<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup.

If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is actually a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
