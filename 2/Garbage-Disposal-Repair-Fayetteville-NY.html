<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a feasible option, particularly when easy plunging does not appear to work. However, there are numerous disadvantages to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they normally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your house and household.</p>
