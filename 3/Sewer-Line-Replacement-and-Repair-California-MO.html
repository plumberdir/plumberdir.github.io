<p>When you have sewer or water line problems, plumbers are the people to call. These lines are susceptible to damage or compromised function because of debris that cleans in or penetration by tree roots.

No matter the issue, you can count on our staff to offer quality services with affordable rates.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Re-piping is a process of replacing the water supply pipes in a home or building. It is a complete replacement of your supply plumbing system.
