<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.

This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
