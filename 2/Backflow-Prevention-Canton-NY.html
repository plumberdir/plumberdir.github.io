Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
