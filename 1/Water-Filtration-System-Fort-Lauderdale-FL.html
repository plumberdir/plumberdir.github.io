<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We recommend organic products, such as Bio-Clean, because they work much better than products including extreme chemicals and won't trigger damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: spray a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, examine to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually changed color. If it has, you probably have a leak.</p>
