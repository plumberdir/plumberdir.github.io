These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required.

The hard water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>

Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
