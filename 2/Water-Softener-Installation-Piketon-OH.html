<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing procedure includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive product. Thomas & Galbraith Heating, Cooling & Plumbing provides repair and replacement services for water heaters in the Cincinnati, Ohio area, along with cities and towns in the surrounding metro. If you notice rusty water, rumbling or banging noises coming from your water heater's tank, an increased quantity of time required to heat your water, or puddles of water under your water heater, it's time to call the experts about repair or replacement alternatives.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this accreditation. I've checked with a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the cost to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

Clean with a soft fabric and then more Coke, over and over, etc. If that does not suffice then utilize Naval Jelly which contains a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to read the instructions and security warnings initially!). Naval Jelly is what we here at Â® use to eliminate rust discolorations and it's readily available at a lot of hardware stores.</p>
