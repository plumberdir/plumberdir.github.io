<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, gently listen and raise the rod. You might be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no adjustment screw, flex the float arm.

Our repair procedures depend on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, imperfections triggered by waste buildup can prevent the liner from adhering to the walls correctly. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that allows for a thorough cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line. The special nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all instructions to enable the water to cover the entire size of the sewer line and supply a mindful cleaning.</p>
