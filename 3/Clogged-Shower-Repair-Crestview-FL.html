<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
