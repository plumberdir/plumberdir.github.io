In some locations of Virginia, where the water is particularly tough with high mineral content, you may need to flush the hot water heater regularly.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
