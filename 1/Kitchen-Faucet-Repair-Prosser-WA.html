<p>The brine tank help the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits nearby to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly focused solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually added to the salt water tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is diminishing, the heavy brine option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>
<p>The majority of softeners have a bypass constructed into the inlet and the outlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you have to supply some type of maintenance to it or even while you're working on installing it. If the softener you select does not have a bypass, then it's a good idea to construct one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to keep the system.</p>
