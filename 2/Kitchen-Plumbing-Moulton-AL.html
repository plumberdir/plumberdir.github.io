<p>With tankless electric heaters, water is warmed straight whenever it's needed. Tankless systems particularly use an element that warms up water when the tap is turned on. The water is continuously heated up as long as the tap stays on. The water stops being heated up if the tap is right away switched off. The heating temperature is generally pre-set to match your needs and preferences. Since they just heat water when required, tankless electric water heaters use less power than standard water heaters.</p>
<p>The majority of cars have a metal line that runs the length of the vehicle with rubber fuel lines connecting at either end, one at the fuel tank and the other to the engine.
