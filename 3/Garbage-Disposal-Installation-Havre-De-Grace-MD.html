<p>If your assembly stops working the annual test, you are responsible for fixing or changing the assembly within 30 days. All replacements must be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the proper type of assembly based upon the conditions on your home (see section below "Required Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Additionally, the assembly must meet the lead complimentary requirement of Area 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the 30 days, all water services will be ceased till the assembly is in compliance.</p>
<p>Fire department connections can be a problem when used in battling a fire. Firemen by and big are not interested in backflow prevention problems. They are interesting in securing people's lives and to a lower level their home. Getting the essential volume of water on a fire is their mission and they will use water from any source available to achieve that objective. This can produce cross-connection control problems and may as a result indicate that the level of protection on the fire defense system might need to be increased to a high hazard protection level.</p>
