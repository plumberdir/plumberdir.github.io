And if your house was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they start to rust. This rust can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have lots of unfavorable effects on your health. Corroded pipes also cause poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you very first shot utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A number of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely hazardous if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make certain to take the suitable safety measures if using one of these items.</p>
