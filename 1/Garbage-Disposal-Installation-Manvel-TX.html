<p>Some pipe materials are more affordable than others; some are more prone and fragile to breaking, displacement or other kinds of structural failure. Other materials are vulnerable to corrosion and rust while some are unaffected. Specific pipe materials have greater coefficients of heat stress, making them more vulnerable to structural tensions and strains as a result of temperature level change and ice formation.

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are installed in locations where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
