<h3>Discover The World Of Faucets For Improved Water Conservation East Haven CT</h3>
<p>These guys were incredible! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job tidying up after it also.</p>
<p>6. Install the new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, called P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your house.
