<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest much more. With this method, you understand the turnkey price going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
<p>If your pipe is failing; one is to repair the bad connection that is causing an interruption, with PVC you have a couple of choices. The other is to go ahead and replace the entire line. If the line is about 40 years old and is revealing signs of age throughout, absolutely replace. Nowadays, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench. Based upon the condition of the line, it may be an appropriate choice to do just that. Nevertheless, if the balanced out worsens trenchless might no longer be an alternative.</p>
