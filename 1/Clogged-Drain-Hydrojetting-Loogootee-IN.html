<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
