<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Whether changing an old one or putting one in for the first time, there are a few things worth knowing about garbage disposal installation. You depend on your water heater every day for all the warm water you and your family need to prepare, clean, and shower. When your water heater stops working appropriately or if it's time for an upgrade, rely on Essig Plumbing & Heating. We provide detailed water heater services in Reading, PA, as well as in Berks and Lehigh counties.

<p>By itself, gas is colorless and odorless. A lot of utility companies add a sulfur compound to gas, which is where the rotten egg odor originates from. That method, you can easily tell if you have a gas leak.

<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat hanger by straightening it. Obviously, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it might be long enough to reach some blockages. Place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog if you can reach it. Beware not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
