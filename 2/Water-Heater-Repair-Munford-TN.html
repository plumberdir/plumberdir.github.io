<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
