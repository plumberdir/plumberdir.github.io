<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc designed and developed a smaller sized design that ran on the exact same principle but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains in addition to laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also constructed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and municipal sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable television. It was terminated in 1973.</p>
<p>Whether a supply of water is labelled "soft" or "hard" is dependent on the existence of 2 extremely soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium.

However, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, perhaps plug pipes and damage water heaters, and decrease the efficiency of soaps and detergents. At this moment the water is said to be tough.</p>
