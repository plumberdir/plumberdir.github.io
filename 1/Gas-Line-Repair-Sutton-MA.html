<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The technician turned off the water system and loosened up the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor. He was then able to eliminate the pipe to clear the clog and reattach the pipe to the toilet component. The customer helped our service technician in moving the toilet back into its correct area, and the technician tightened the bolts prior to restoring the supply of water and ensuring that the toilet was appropriately flushing.</p>
<p>Today, most experts suggest a careful inspection of residential hot water heater on a regular basis - at least annually. Malfunctioning water heaters cause a variety of problems.
