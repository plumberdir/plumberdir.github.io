<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Contractors in Lowville</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This rust, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Inspect Valves and Dual Checks. There are two other kinds of backflow preventers available that you may face. The first is a check valve. The second is a dual check". It is NOT the same thing as a Check although it might be marketed as one! Don't get swindled! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Dual Checks have losses similar to Check (5 PSI).</p>
