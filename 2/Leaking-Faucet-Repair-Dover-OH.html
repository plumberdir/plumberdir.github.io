<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and expensive plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or home appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause an obstruction or can trigger deterioration that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Noise-- Over time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets hard and eliminates from the capacity of your water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the sound.</p>

Corrosion can still happen under conditions that agree with to the formation of hard-water scale or even when hard-water scale is already present.</p>
<p>Today's high-efficiency softeners are altering the economics of water softening in the carwash industry.
