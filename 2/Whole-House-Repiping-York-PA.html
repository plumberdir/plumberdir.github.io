<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on pipes. Over an amount of time the within lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a small pinhole leak will establish. Sometimes the solution is to repair the damaged area of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is needed to solve the concern. Other times a more comprehensive option is needed: repiping.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are needed to conduct site inspections to identify if a backflow prevention device is required as a result of a actual or possible  cross-connection risk on a client's plumbing system. Plumbing and gas piping inspections found on Vashon Island are only carried out on Wednesdays.

The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
