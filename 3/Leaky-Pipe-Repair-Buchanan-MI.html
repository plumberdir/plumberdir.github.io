<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a sensible quantity, there should be no problem in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a few food products you must most likely not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make certain the drain is clear.</p>

Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work.

If utilizing one of these items, please make sure to take the suitable preventative measures.</p>
