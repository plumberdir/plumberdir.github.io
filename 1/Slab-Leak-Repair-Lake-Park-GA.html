<p>Each part of the assembly should be checked to determine what needs repair.

Local plumber quoted price of $400 to install plus cost of garbage disposal. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ delighted I inspected around. Under the sink, position a container or pan underneath the waste pipe, then use locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to disconnect the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's drain. To loosen the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
