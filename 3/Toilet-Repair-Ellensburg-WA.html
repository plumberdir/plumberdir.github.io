<p>Backflow preventers are a relatively simple system, regardless of their importance. The majority of commercial use backflow prevention setups use a valve system that connects with the irrigation line within your business, where watering meets the main water system. From here, the preventer can keep track of the movement of water within your system, and prevent any possible back-pressure and back-siphonage that may be caused by malfunctioning plumbing devices. This makes sure that water within sprinkler systems, water pumps, and other watering and wastewater systems stays disconnected from clean" water.</p>
