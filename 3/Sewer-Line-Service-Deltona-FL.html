<p>There are a number of things that can fail with your sewer line. Like all pipes, the sewer line will not last forever. It has been in place considering that your home was built so it is about the exact same age as your house. There are some things that can harm a sewer pipe such as freeze and thaw cycles and corrosion. Blunt force can break a pipe, such as when building and construction is being done at or near your house.</p>
<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair specialist understands the appropriate installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. A lot of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly just be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
<p>Much like other things in life, the pipes that deliver cold and hot water throughout your house, along with drain water and sewage away, do ultimately break and need to be changed. They have a helpful life-span, which can vary from 25 years to eighty years. Nevertheless, there are specific signs you should watch for, as these could reduce the anticipated lifespan of your home's plumbing.</p>
