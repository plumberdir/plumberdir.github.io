<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet.

<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt due to the fact that they restore whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, typically restore after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have an ever-changing water use schedule, such designs are practical.</p>
