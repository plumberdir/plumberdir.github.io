<p>Inspect the house's warm water heater You will be seeking to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your needs (a family of four should have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the water heater's age. Examine to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can choose the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will mean that less water will be heated up and readily available for use.
