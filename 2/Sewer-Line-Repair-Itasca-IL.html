<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
