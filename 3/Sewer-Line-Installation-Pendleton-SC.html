<p>Many house owners think their utility companies or homeowners insurance coverage is accountable for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, but the reality is that in many cases you, the homeowner, are accountable. Many basic property owners insurance policies and local utility companies or municipalities do not cover repairs to or replacement of the major systems around your house.</p>

So, you'll observe the exact same problems cropping up once again and again, although you have actually had them repaired.

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to describe an unwanted flow of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water brings pollutants back to the primary water system system, making the water in it unsafe to consume.</p>
