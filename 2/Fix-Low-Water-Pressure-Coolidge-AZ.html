<p>Changing the old disposal with a similar new one is less complex than changing with a various model. So, if you are not looking specifically for a various disposal this may be something to consider. A completely various disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink adapter has to be puttied into location. A secure seal is a must. Once connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is attached. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, making sure to connect wires properly, and the base covered to safeguard the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
