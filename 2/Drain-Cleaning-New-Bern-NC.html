<p>Whether a water system is identified "soft" or "difficult" depends on the presence of two extremely soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health viewpoint, these minerals have no negative impacts and are, in fact, necessary day-to-day nutrients. It is minerals that offer water the revitalizing flavor many people discover desirable. Nevertheless, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they buildup on contact surface areas, possibly plug pipes and damage hot water heater, and decrease the effectiveness of soaps and cleaning agents. At this point the water is said to be tough.</p>
<p>The majority of typical single household home systems will not need supply piping bigger than 3⁄4 inch (19 mm) due to cost in addition to steel piping's tendency to end up being obstructed from internal rusting and mineral deposits forming on the inside of the pipe with time once the internal galvanizing zinc finish has broken down. In safe and clean water distribution service, galvanized steel pipe has a service life of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not unusual for it to be less in geographic areas with destructive water contaminants.</p>
