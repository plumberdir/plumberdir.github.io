<p>Split sewer pipes can be more than just a pricey repair-- they can lead to substantial and costly property damage and lead to serious health risks.

<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove debris such as tough water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
