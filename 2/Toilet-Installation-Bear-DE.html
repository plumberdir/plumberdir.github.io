<p>A second part of the Battelle Research study compared detergent dose, water hardness, and washing temperature level to see if solidity had an effect on detergent cost savings. The research study included tests that got rid of hard soils, in addition to assessing filming and spotting. Scientists found that softened water utilizes practically 30% less detergent, but cleans along with water at 10 gpg hardness level. That detergent cost savings increases to almost 70% when comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level.</p>
