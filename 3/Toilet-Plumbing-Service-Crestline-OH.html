<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for most construction contractors (or their employees). The secret to the technology is having the ability to control both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thereby getting rid of firmness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regeneration of active sites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief innovation officer. This technology is more cost effective and lasts longer than typical water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>

Obviously, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it may be long enough to reach some blockages. If you can reach it, place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to press through or pull out the clog. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
<p>Today's high-efficiency softeners are altering the economics of water softening in the carwash industry. Traditionally, the cost savings have actually been based mostly on lowering chemical and cleaning agent costs.
