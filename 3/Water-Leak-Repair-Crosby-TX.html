<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the tough water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers declare that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually revealed a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>

With well water, these signs might also be paired with iron stains and sulfur-smells coming from the tap.</p>
