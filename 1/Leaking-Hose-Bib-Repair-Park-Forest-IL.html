<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in locations where the ambient temperature is preserved at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water flows right away from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In scenarios where there is a need to provide sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small packing dock, an antifreeze system can be used. The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high risk defense assembly.</p>
