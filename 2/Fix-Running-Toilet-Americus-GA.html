Some elements may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An essential thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the style of each component. If the part is not fixed effectively, the guide could limit the movement (rather than direct or constant) of the component, which might trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
