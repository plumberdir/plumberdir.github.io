<p>Video cameras are one of the most valuable tools in the plumbing business. When looking for a brand-new flapper, your best choice is to attempt and discover the same flapper that initially featured your existing flush valve. The simplest method to do that is by looking up your toilet design and selecting the flapper advised for that model. If you do not understand your model number, however, we do use an extensive choice of "will fit" flappers to assist you out. View the video listed below to read more about the various kinds of flappers readily available, or check out How To Replace Toilet Flappers for brief tutorials on changing toilet flappers, tank balls, and flush valve seals.</p>

Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in.
