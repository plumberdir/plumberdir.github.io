<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Company in Mableton</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water ended up being standard. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Is your home 50+ years of ages? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the primary material utilized in plumbing. While galvanized steel is strong, it usually succumbs to rust after about 50 years and requires replacement. Even more modern pipes won't last forever, so keep an eye on plumbing systems that could be reaching completion of their lifespan.</p>
