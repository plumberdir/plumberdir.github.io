<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is necessary that the repair service technician understands the appropriate installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
<p>Many typical single family home systems won't require supply piping larger than 3⁄4 inch (19 mm) due to cost in addition to steel piping's propensity to end up being obstructed from internal rusting and mineral deposits forming on the within the pipe in time once the internal galvanizing zinc coating has degraded. In safe and clean water circulation service, galvanized steel pipe has a service life of about 30 to 50 years, although it is not uncommon for it to be less in geographic areas with corrosive water impurities.</p>
