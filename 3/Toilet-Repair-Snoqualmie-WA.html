<p>Backflow is the unwanted reversal of flow in a potable water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only stream in one direction. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always flow toward the point of lowest pressure. If a water pipe were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help battle a fire, the pressure in the water pipe could drop. The need upstream could trigger a turnaround in circulation.</p>
<p>Plumbers normally start as apprentices. From there, they test and make a journey plumbing license, and eventually be granted a master plumbing license. Excess Hair: Your shower or bathtub is typically ground zero for obstructions. As hair integrates with soap, it can create the best storm for plumbing blockages.
