<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and intricate plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping.

This sediment eventually gets difficult and removes from the capability of your water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>

The kitchen sink drain may need a basic tightening or a replacement. You will see the apparent spray if the leak is in the pressurized hose spray.
