<p>Hydro-jetting is a technique of removing build up and debris in tanks and lines by utilizing extremely high-pressure water to get rid of clogs. These blockages could have been made from grease, heavy sludge, or tree roots that have built up with time. Hydro jetting's innovative technology enables the process to be quick and effective. Due to the fact that it can be dangerous if done by someone with no training or experience, this procedure needs to be done by licensed plumbers.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
