<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is an individual choice. Water softener systems work by getting rid of hardness minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener alternative in areas where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not successfully remove solidity from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
