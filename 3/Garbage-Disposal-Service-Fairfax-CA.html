<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Fairfax CA</h3>
<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has often been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process.

The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not need. Nevertheless, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this choice a considerable one.</p>
