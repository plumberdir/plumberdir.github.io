<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on an established schedule and after that go back to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt since they regrow whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, usually regrow after numerous gallons of water have been softened. If you have an ever-changing water use schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
