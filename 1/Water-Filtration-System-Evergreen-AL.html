You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by discussing all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
