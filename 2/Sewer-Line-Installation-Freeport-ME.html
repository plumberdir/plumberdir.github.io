During regeneration, salty water from the salt water tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are eliminated the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
<p>A continuous-feed waste disposal unit is the most typical type which continues to run as long as the power switch is on.
