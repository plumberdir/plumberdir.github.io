<p>The source or place of a sewer issue identifies who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (normally 10 feet large) where main sewage systems traverse private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Everybody who's installed a couple of disposals is aware of this mistake: Forgetting to get rid of the dishwasher knockout prior to hanging the unit. Running water: If the toilet runs even when it hasn't been just recently used and you have actually replaced the flapper, the problem might be larger than it appears. The tank ultimately loses its capability to seal properly, creating waste and a greater water costs.</p>
