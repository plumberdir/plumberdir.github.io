Difficult water hinders the lathering of hair shampoos and soaps, triggering you to utilize more. Tough water also makes it more difficult to clean soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itching of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that hard water causes your skin to flake, itch, and redden frequently.</p>
