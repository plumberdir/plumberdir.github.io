The program uses minor installation labels and random inspections instead of regular electrical and plumbing licenses for specific kinds of minor electrical and plumbing work. Your backflow preventer failed inspection due to excessive greenery. Please trim back your plants and arrange for testing with a company from our certified tester list This must be finished within 30 days to avoid water service disturbance.</p>
