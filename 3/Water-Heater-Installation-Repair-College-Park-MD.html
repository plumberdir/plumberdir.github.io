<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for most construction contractors (or their employees). The secret to the innovation is having the ability to control both the crystal development rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thereby eliminating hardness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active websites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary innovation officer. This technology is more cost reliable and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Filtration in sink taps and fridge water dispensers enhances water's taste, but its high price tag makes it not practical as a household service. Packaged chemicals soften water in little batches, such as washing machine loads, however render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothing, and, sometimes, include phosphates that damage the environment. A clogged sewer pipe could leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning fraud.</p>
