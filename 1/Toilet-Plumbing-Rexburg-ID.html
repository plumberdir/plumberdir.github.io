Before installing, your professional will turn off water and electrical energy to the area. Next, the old sink flange is gotten rid of and cleaned of any putty residue. Then, a new mounting ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is hooked up to its mount. In this technique, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get sped up.</p>
<p>No warm water-- The lack of warm water is the greatest indication that there is something wrong with your San Antonio hot water heater. If you aren't getting adequate warm water for your shower, then you might have sediment that has actually built up in the system and separated the water from the heat source.
