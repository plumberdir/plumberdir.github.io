<p>If pressure is lost, a backflow preventer stops water inside your water pipes from streaming back to the City system. Backflow can contaminate the water system. The standard system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow prevention device, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. All leaks, broken fittings, and other plumbing problems will be solved.</p>
<p>Because of the fundamental style of a minimized pressure backflow assembly, changing supply pressure on a very low flow or static circulation condition might cause annoyance leaking and prospective fouling of the assembly. While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve immediately ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure consistent to the assembly in times of changing supply pressure.</p>
