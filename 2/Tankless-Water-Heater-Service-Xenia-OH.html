Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be heated and readily available for usage. Also, corrosion of the tank's aspects can cause the tank to have a short life. Request that a new one be set up if the water heater is old or you see obvious signs of corrosion.</p>
