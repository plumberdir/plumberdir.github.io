It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be removed from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from crucial areas in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>
