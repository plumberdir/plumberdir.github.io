<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the many part, a garbage disposal is just geared up to handle softer natural waste. If bones or other hard foods get stuck in the disposal, it could trigger it to jam and not work properly. By running hot water through the disposal, you might have the ability to clear the clog yourself. Nevertheless you run the risk of damaging the motor or blades.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not uncommon, but if your toilet is clogging more than three times a month, there's a larger problem to take a look at. You might need to change toilet paper or employ a plumber to clear a clog from the drain if your toilet is fairly new. The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing agency where you can look up your state's licensing details. Check the list of state licensing companies to learn whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also maintains a licensing tool to inspect state licensing requirements.</p>
