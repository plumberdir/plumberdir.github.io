Like any house appliance, a toilet tank includes numerous small moving parts that might need changed with usage over time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all break and trigger toilet leakages that aren't clearly noticeable to the naked eye. Toilet leakages around the base can also happen around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in areas where the possibility of a serious fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
