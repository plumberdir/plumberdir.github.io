For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more rapidly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst.

Possibilities are that your home might need extensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can operate at optimal rates if your home was developed decades prior to that.</p>
