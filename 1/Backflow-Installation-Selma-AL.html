<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains.

You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
