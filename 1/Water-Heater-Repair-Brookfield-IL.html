<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or certification requirements for the majority of building contractors (or their workers). The secret to the technology is having the ability to control both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, consequently getting rid of solidity ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary technology officer. This technology is more cost efficient and lasts longer than common water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Our group at All Phase Plumbing also utilizes drain cleaning technology to prepare your sewer and drain pipes for repair. Trenchless pipe repair is a kind of pipe repair that does not involve any excavation. Trenchless pipe repair also called trenchless pipe lining is a excellent and durable  option for your broken pipes. The pipe lining procedure involves our group saturating a felt liner with an unique resin mix. It is pushed through your pipeline when the felt liner is completely saturated. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all fractures and flaws. If heat is used, the liner is left to harden in location for several hours or 60 minutes. Once the process is total, the liner will be removed and your pipe will be checked one more time to make sure your brand-new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>
