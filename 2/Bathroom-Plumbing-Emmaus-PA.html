<p>Aside from these two essential components, there are a myriad of small, possibly less crucial things that can break or weaken. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more rapidly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>
