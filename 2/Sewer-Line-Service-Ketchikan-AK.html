<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from the house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, corrosion or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for periodic sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>

Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.
