Discolored water signifies rust in your pipes or water heater. If your water is an uncommon color, this warrants professional attention. New gas line installations are provided for brand-new appliances like burners, ranges, outdoor lighting, and grills. Products include pipes, valves and fasteners. The size of the pipes should be proportional to the size of the appliance being set up.</p>

If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
