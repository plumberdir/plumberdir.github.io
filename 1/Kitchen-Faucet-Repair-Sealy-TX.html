<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future.

When installing a new toilet, the plumber may likewise need to make modifications to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the total cost of the job.</p>
