<h3>Shower Repairs in Renton WA 98058 - The Processes Involved</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the perpetrator. But not constantly. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
