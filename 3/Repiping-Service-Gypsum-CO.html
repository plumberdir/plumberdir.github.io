Non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be required into the potable supply system if these connections are not properly secured.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of flow in a potable water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only stream in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always flow toward the point of most affordable pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help combat a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The demand upstream could trigger a reversal in circulation.</p>
