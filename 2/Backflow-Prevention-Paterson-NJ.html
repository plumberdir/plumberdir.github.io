<p>Replacing the old disposal with a similar brand-new one is less complex than replacing with a different model. So, if you are not looking particularly for a different disposal this might be something to think about. A totally different disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink connector has to be puttied into place. A safe seal is a must.

<p>In some cases, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
