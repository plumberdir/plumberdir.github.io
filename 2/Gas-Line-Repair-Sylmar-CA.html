The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide should be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH back down. When it comes to pipe repair, the most costly aspects aren't the machinery or products used, but the yard, landscaping and uprooting damage that takes place.</p>
