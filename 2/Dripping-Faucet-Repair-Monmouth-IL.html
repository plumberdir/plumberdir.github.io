The repair might be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.

When a trained tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
