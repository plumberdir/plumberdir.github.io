<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in West Jefferson NC 28694</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
