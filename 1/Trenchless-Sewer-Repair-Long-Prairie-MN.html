<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Long Prairie MN</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
