<p>As a locally-owned organisation, integrity and duty are incredibly essential to developing a credibility for excellence. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the drinkable supply of water within a structure these devices are referred to as isolation" BFP. Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air gap, if there is no other way to supply one, then we inspect to see that the proper BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>

<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly focused option of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually contributed to the salt water tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is reducing, the heavy brine solution is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the brine tank runs out of salt.</p>
