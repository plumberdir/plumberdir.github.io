<p>Seeking to repair or replace your waste disposal unit? The California Plumbing License Exam is required in order to work as a licensed contractor in California Any person who intends to work as a plumbing contractor that is accountable for constructing, modifying, or fixing a structure or structure needs to be licensed.

An easy mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly ravage $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floorings and make complex the task with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and lawsuits. With so much riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick to only the very best.</p>
