<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Lawrenceburg KY 40342</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>

Nevertheless, if you want to ensure a precise repair or installation, call our licensed plumbers for assistance.</p>
