<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or certification requirements for a lot of building and construction contractors (or their staff members). The secret to the technology is having the ability to manage both the crystal development rate and their removal from our polymer beads, therefore getting rid of hardness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active websites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary technology officer. This technology is more cost reliable and lasts longer than typical water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are needed to conduct site inspections to determine if a backflow prevention device is needed as a result of a real or potential  cross-connection danger on a consumer's plumbing system.

<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in areas where the ambient temperature level is kept at or above 40 ° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water streams instantly from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In situations where there is a need to supply sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a small filling dock, an antifreeze system can be used. The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high hazard protection assembly.</p>
