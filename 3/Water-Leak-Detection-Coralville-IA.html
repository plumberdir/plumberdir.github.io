<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk circumstances is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
