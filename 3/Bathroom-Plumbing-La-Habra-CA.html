<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic deterioration Direct contact between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed since of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is likewise worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>

<p>Fire department connections can be an issue when utilized in fighting a fire. Firemen by and large are not concerned with backflow prevention problems. They are worrying about safeguarding people's lives and to a lesser extent their home. Getting the needed volume of water on a fire is their objective and they will use water from any source offered to attain that goal. This can produce cross-connection control problems and might as a result mean that the level of defense on the fire security system may need to be increased to a high danger security level.</p>
