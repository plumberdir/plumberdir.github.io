<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that need to be preserved. A crucial thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a really important part of the style of each component. If the component is not repaired effectively, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than direct or stable) of the element, which might cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is required.</p>
