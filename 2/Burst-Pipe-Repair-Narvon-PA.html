<p>For plumbing work other that repair or replacement components, a structure permit is typically required before a plumbing license can be issued. Soften only what you need to. People typically select to soften showers, sinks, and laundry hookups. Toilets, hose bibs, basement sinks, and other cold water taps typically do not need to be linked to a softener. In many cases, individuals choose to soften just the hot water.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend much more. With this approach, you know the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
