<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer package will be attached to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws originally meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The consecutive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can cause improper drainage.

<h3>Drains Blocked Find A Good Emergency Plumber Now Fishkill NY</h3>
