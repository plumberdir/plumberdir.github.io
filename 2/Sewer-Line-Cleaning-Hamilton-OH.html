<p>Keep in mind: Hard water stops your washing cleaning agent from working effectively due to the fact that hard water ions can bond with detergent particles to deactivate them. You, therefore, have to utilize increasingly more detergent to achieve the very same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Difficult minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and sanitized during regeneration. Lastly, water consisting of the hard minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
