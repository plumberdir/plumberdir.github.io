Blanc likewise developed a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning big industrial and community sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could likewise thread telephone cable. It was ceased in 1973.</p>
<p>Some makers declare that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
