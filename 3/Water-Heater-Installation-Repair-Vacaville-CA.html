<p>I can't state enough good ideas about this company. Had a sewer repair needed and had an extremely brief amount of time due to closing on a house sale. Every single individual I encountered from Marquita doing logistics for my task to every member of the work crew. Friendly, interacted well, absolutely responsive and truly cared to help me through this really difficult job. All of the people I came across were good example for what a well run service company must be. Much thanks and appreciation. You're terrific.</p>
<p>Carefully listen and lift the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no adjustment screw, bend the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's adjusted correctly (Photo 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these changes.</p>
