<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a terrific man. He informed me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) in advance and delivered as guaranteed. I will definitely utilize Clog Dawg again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70.

<p>The on-demand gas heater can conserve as much as 35% of the energy needed for heated water if your house utilizes around 45 gallons of hot water each day. They can also reduce the energy needed for houses with far higher needs too. Homes that use over 80 gallons of hot water every day can conserve as much as 14% by changing to these smaller water heaters.

<p>If your pipe is stopping working; one is to repair the bad connection that is causing a stoppage, with PVC you have a couple of choices. The other is to go ahead and replace the whole line. If the line is about 40 years old and is revealing indications of age throughout, definitely replace. These days, you can replace the pipe without a digging trench.
