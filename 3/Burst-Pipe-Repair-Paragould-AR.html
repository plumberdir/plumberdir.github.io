<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on pipes. Over a period of time the within lining of the pipe will deteriorate and a little pinhole leak will develop. Sometimes the solution is to repair the damaged area of pipe, and an area repair is all that is needed to resolve the issue. Other times a more substantial solution is required: repiping.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham inspects backflow assemblies upon installation and performs periodic re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies must be evaluated by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report should be supplied to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste better. The minerals in hard water can trigger a bad smell and taste. It gets rid of the mineral material to produce odorless drinking water that tastes great when you add a water softener.</p>
