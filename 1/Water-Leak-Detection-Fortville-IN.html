<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two various kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
