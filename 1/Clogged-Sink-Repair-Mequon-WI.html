That's 700 gallons of water a month simply to keep your water softener up and running.</p>

You, therefore, need to utilize more and more cleaning agent to accomplish the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt service. Tough minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned and decontaminated throughout regeneration. Lastly, water containing the hard minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
