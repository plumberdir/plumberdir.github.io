<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
