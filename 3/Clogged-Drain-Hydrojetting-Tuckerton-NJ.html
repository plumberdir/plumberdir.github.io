<p>If it slowly drains away as you work, add more hot water. Keep plunging till the drain is clear or you choose it's time to attempt a new method. Tankless units connect straight to your plumbing and just heat the water as it is needed. This leads to cost savings on your energy costs.

<p>The standard hot water heater has a tank that is filled with continuously heated water. It wastes energy by holding the temperature of water that is not currently in use.

<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an additional layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
