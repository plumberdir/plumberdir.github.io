<p>Natural gas is the one we are most closely exposed to. This gas is utilized for heating our houses, for lightening our stoves, and for running home appliances such as water heaters. This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially referred to as marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally occurring gas that occurs in the earth's crust and is also sometimes formed by the rotting of organic matters like sewage or manure. As useful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas hazardous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer.
