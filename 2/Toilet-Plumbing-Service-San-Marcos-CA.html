<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Inappropriate installation is likewise a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to find.</p>
