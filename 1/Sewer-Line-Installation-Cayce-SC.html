<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is since if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
