<p>One typical way for a house's water supply to be infected is if the watering water lines, which might end up being tainted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. The issue might spread significantly if that polluted water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only protects drinking water in individual homes, it likewise prevents wastewater in personal houses from flowing back out and infecting the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test information implies for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
