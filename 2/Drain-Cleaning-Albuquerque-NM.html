Blanc also developed a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be pulled by a truck and featured a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big industrial and community sewer pipes.

<h3>What To Do During Emergency Plumbing Situations Albuquerque NM</h3>
