<p>In water distribution systems, water is generally kept at a substantial pressure to enable water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might be or stop working reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Lowered pressure in the pipe might enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
