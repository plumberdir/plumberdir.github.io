<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by removing solidity minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that assist prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by neutralizing the solidity itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often thought about a greener option in locations where it is prohibited to utilize salt.
