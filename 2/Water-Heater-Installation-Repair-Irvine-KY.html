<h3>Things To Consider Before Hiring A Plumber Irvine KY</h3>

Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
