<p>There's a good opportunity you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your home was built in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to rust. This rust can lead to a buildup of lead, which can have many negative impacts on your health. Corroded pipes also lead to poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the difficult water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to explain an unwanted circulation of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water brings contaminants back to the primary water supply system, making the water in it risky to consume.</p>
