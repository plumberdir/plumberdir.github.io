<h3>How To Keep A Blocked Toilet From Becoming A Plumbing Catastrophe at Marietta GA 30062</h3>
<p>If you've constantly lived in an area with hard water, you may not recognize how much it impacts you-- but if you've just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too familiar with the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from difficult water.

Difficult water also makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that tough water causes your skin to flake, itch, and redden frequently.</p>
