<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Hampstead NC</h3>
<p>In water circulation systems, water is normally kept at a significant pressure to enable water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may stop working or be reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water system (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as tough water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
