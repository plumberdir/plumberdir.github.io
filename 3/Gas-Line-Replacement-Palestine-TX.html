<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
