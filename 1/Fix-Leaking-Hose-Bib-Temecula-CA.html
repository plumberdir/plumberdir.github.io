<p>So, what's a backflow prevention valve? This is a device that ensures non-potable water doesn't return into the main supply of water system.

Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
