<p>Galvanized steel potable water system and circulation pipes are typically discovered with small pipe sizes from 3⁄8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm). It is hardly ever used today for new building and construction residential plumbing. Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) standard tapered male threads, which get in touch with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (frequently recognized just as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is reasonably expensive, and challenging to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It remains in typical use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building code non-combustibility requirements normally discovered in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications. It is also exceptionally durable and resistant to mechanical abuse. Black lacquered steel pipe is the most extensively used pipe product for fire sprinklers and natural gas.</p>
