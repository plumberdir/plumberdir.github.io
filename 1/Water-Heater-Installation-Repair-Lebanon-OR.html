<p>3. Solar Salt comes from vaporized seawater and may in some cases leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in sinks and tubs. The pink movie is really a harmless germs that originates from the sea salt. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) suggests switching to one of the other two types of salts if this stain is an annoyance in your house.

But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this approach, you know the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
