<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
