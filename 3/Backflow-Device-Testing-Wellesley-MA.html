<p>When a natural gas line is ruptured, it immediately ends up being a severe security risk. Without being repaired as quickly as possible, it might cause quite a bit of damage if the gas inside becomes ignited. The first concern is to turn off the supply of natural gas and call the utility company if a person realizes that they have actually ruptured a gas line.</p>
<p>If you see low water pressure or discolored water, it usually represents rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals build up gradually, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you might observe lower water pressure.
