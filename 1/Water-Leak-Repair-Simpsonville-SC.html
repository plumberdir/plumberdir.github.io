<h3>Clogged Drains Driving You Crazy Never Call The Emergency Plumber Again Simpsonville SC</h3>
<p>The most effective method to deal with tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Was your house constructed prior to the 1970s and has not gone through renovation or pipe replacement? It is likely that your pipes are made of galvanized metal or another product which has corroded and decomposed over the years if so. Older pipes can cause major leaks and even infect your water as they decay. Even the highest quality pipes won't last forever and will need to be changed.</p>
