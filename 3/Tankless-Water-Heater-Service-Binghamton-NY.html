It really isn't an excellent concept to use a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to small, unless they have been particularly developed to fit normal toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to slide around, or will not disperse your weight evenly and might eventually trigger cracks in the bowl.</p>
