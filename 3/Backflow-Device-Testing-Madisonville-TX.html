<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the general public supply of water and private on-site water supply and circulation systems by prohibiting cross-connections between safe and clean (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by needing installation of primary and secondary backflow prevention approaches. Secondary backflow approaches supply an increased level of security for the general public supply of water system.</p>
<p>The next requirements to examine is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is very important that the repair specialist knows the proper installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly.

The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is essential that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
