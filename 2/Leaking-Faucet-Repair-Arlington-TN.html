Water pressure might fail or be lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe might permit infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
