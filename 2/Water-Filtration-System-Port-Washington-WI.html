<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
