<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Cost of associated materials and products normally needed to install garbage disposal including: ports, fittings and installing hardware. You can save cash. While a water softener will be a financial investment, you can save money on energy bills because water-using appliances will operate more effectively, utilizing less energy. Plus, since those device can have a longer life with soft water, you won't have to replace them as soon.</p>

Running water: If the toilet runs even when it hasn't been recently used and you have actually changed the flapper, the issue might be larger than it appears. The tank eventually loses its capability to seal appropriately, developing waste and a higher water expense.</p>
