<p>Galvanized metal, is simply an easier way of saying zinc coated" and what causes galvanized pipes to corrode is the direct exposure to too much water and minerals. You may be believing that it does not make sense to utilize a pipe that reacts with water as your home's main source of water transportation, and you would be correct.

<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not really the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>

We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that allows for a detailed cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line. The special nozzle connected to the hose directs the water in all directions to permit the water to cover the entire size of the sewer line and offer a mindful cleaning.</p>
