<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that permits water to go through it in one instructions, however prevents it from going backwards in the opposite instructions. You have long-term water firmness if you don't see limescale accumulation but instead see soap residue, your washing detergents not working as efficiently or your skin getting scratchy and sensitive. Do not try to locate the leak if you smell gas. Instead, leave your house or structure immediately. Do not switch on or off any electrical switches, appliances, or lights, as an electrical charge might develop a trigger. When you are in a safe location, call the Peoples emergency hotline.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not required to get this accreditation. I have actually checked with a couple of plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the price to be significantly less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
