<p>Aside from these two crucial parts, there are a myriad of small, possibly less important things that can degrade or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part needs to be in good shape for it to work at its best.</p>
