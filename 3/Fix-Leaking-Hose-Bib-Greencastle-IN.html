<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a fantastic man. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) up front and provided as promised. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical per hour rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay might be greater.</p>

As rust and minerals build up gradually, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you might notice lower water pressure.

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can end up being a health risk in your water.</p>
