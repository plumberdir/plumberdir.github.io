<p>The program accomplishes its objective by attending to the adoption and promulgation of suitable rules and regulations for the building of plumbing centers where mandated. Cold showers? High energy costs? It may be time for a new hot water heater. But in order to reap the benefits of a brand-new energy-efficient device, you'll need to have it set up appropriately. A water heater that is not set up correctly can lead to water damage, scalding temperature levels, or even a fire. That's why installation is best left to professional plumbers who understand the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>Rusting and deterioration on the outside of the hot water heater, inlet pipes, or parts can suggest a potential problem with the hot water heater. If it is more than 6 or 7 years old, it can likewise suggest the water heater is near the end of its life. With heavy corrosion buildup on valves for water lines to and from the heater, it could mean that there have actually been fluctuations in pressure causing little leakages.</p>

<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the public water system and personal on-site supply of water and distribution systems by prohibiting cross-connections in between potable (ideal for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by requiring installation of main and secondary backflow prevention techniques. Secondary backflow methods offer an increased level of defense for the general public water supply system.</p>
