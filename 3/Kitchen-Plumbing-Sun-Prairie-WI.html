<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
