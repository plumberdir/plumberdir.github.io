<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, that makes its plumbing's effective functioning a requirement more than a need. When the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be switched on very gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system.
