From here, the preventer can monitor the movement of water within your system, and prevent any potential back-pressure and back-siphonage that may be triggered by malfunctioning plumbing equipment.

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
