<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is an individual preference. Water softener systems work by eliminating solidity minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale.

Water conditioners do not effectively eliminate solidity from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
