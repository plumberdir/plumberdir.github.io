Leakages can also occur if you bump into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from happening, install the system in a safe and steady  place. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener doesn't fall over and remove the plumbing.

<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
