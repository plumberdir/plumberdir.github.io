<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you very first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really harmful if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the proper preventative measures if using among these items.</p>
