<p>Many property owners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to fix their clogged or filthy drain issues.

Store-bought liquid drain cleaners utilize harsh chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with duplicated use, these chemicals will likewise gnaw at the pipe creating weak points that are vulnerable to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is constantly advised.</p>
<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. A lot of these cleaners include concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely hazardous if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these products, please make sure to take the suitable safety measures.</p>
