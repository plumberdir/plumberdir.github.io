<p>As a locally-owned organisation, integrity and duty are extremely essential to developing a track record for quality. Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses security of the safe and clean water supply within a building these devices are referred to as isolation" BFP. Once again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no way to provide one, then we check to see that the proper BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months thereafter.</p>
