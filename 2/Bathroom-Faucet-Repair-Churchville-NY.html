<p>Your sewer line is among the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being damaged or clogged, it could wreak undesirable concerns on your residential or commercial property. .

The best method to lower accumulation is have a professional flush it at least once a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is particularly tough with high mineral material, you might need to flush the water heater more often.</p>
