<p>Commercial sink plumbing is more complex than residential bathroom or kitchen sink plumbing. Commercial sinks manage more water and have a more effective straining system to keep food and other particles out of the plumbing system. In reality, commercial sink drains have more parts than residential sink drains. If your commercial sinks have a clogged drain, call the professionals at Roto-Rooter. We offer a complete variety of commercial drain services to help you keep your establishment running smoothly. We offer sink repair, toilet repair, shower repair and can even fix floor drains.</p>
<p>Set up under the kitchen sink, a garbage disposal uses sharp blades and a motor to grind (and virtually melt) food waste so it can stream down through the drains and into the sewer system. Leakages-- The disposal may leak into the cupboard area below the sink, resulting in possible water damage and other issues. Depending on your requirements, we can help you select an overflow or no-overflow choice for a new sink drain.
