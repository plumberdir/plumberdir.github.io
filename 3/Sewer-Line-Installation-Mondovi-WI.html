<p>Once the elements are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is all set to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to move to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from crucial areas in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will build up.</p>
