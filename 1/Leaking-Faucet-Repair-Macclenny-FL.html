<p>The heating aspect is taking longer to heat the water than it should if the water feels warm. However this specific problem is when you have no hot water streaming in your home.

If it is one of the mentioned issues, a repair or replacement of the components might be enough. Nevertheless, if the water heater system has all of these problems happening frequently, then a water heater replacement is required.</p>

You may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one if so. This typically includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
