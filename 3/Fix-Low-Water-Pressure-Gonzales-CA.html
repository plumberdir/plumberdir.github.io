<p>A total repipe of a home's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and pricey plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the house and place of the pipe, it was a difficult job. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working prior to they left. I am really grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>

Double Checks have losses similar to Double Checks (5 PSI).</p>

<p>A. Usually wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
