Double Checks have losses similar to Double Checks (5 PSI).</p>

<p>The water utilized to restore the softener beads winds up as waste.

<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk scenarios is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
