The salt water tank holds a highly focused solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand added to the salt water tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capacity of the resin is lessening, the heavy brine option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the brine tank runs out of salt.</p>
