<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
