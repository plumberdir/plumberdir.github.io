<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
