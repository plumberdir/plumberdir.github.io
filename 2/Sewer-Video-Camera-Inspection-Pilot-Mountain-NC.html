<p>Food scraps compose approximately 20% of all household waste. If it can quickly and quickly be disposed of through the sink, this large amount of trash does not need to go in the garbage can. A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of traveling through the sewage pipes without impeding water circulation. By installing a garbage disposal you are assisting the environment by conserving the amount of trash that gets sent out to garbage dumps and other dumping areas. With a waste disposal unit the garbage is handled through already existing water facilities.</p>
