<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
