Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, deterioration or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to find the reason for routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>
