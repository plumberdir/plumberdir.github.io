<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great guy. He informed me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as promised. I will certainly utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay may be higher.</p>
<p>If you see low water pressure or blemished water, it typically represents rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals build up with time, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you may notice lower water pressure. The discoloration takes place when rust becomes loose from the pipes and circulation into your water system, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can become a health threat in your water.</p>
<p>Backpressure happens when the pressure in a private water supply surpasses the pressure in the general public water distribution lines that can cause regular circulation to reverse. A pump used to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a greater floor might trigger this. Preventive cleaning for drains should be carried out on all drains, consisting of toilet, floor, tub and sink drains.</p>
