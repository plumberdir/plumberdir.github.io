<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
