<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information suggests for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
