<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
