It is necessary to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger a properly functioning RPZ assembly to periodically release small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be installed in locations based on water damage. Sufficient drainage must also be offered.</p>

The backflow prevention assembly should be disassembled and parts changed with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly must be evaluated once again to be sure it was appropriately repaired. Comparing the test arises from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the producers flow diagram is essential to guarantee it was fixed appropriately. A properly fixed assembly must provide years of protection.</p>
