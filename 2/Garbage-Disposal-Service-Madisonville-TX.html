<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>

<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
