To fix this problem, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
<p>Filtration in sink taps and refrigerator water dispensers enhances water's taste, but its steep price makes it impractical as a household solution. Packaged chemicals soften water in small batches, such as washing machine loads, however render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothing, and, sometimes, contain phosphates that damage the environment. A clogged sewer pipe might leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning scam.</p>
