<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
