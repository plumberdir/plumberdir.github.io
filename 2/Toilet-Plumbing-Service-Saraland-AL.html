<h3>What To Do During Emergency Plumbing Situations Saraland AL</h3>
<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
