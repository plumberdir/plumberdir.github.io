This is due largely to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to customer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening merely removes hardness minerals and eliminates problems that are a problem and not a risk to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not need. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and disadvantages, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
