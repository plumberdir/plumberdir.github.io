<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
