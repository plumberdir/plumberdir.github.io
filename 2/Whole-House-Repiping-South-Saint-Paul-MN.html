All replacements must be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the proper kind of assembly based on the conditions on your home (see section listed below "Needed Backflow Prevention Assemblies") In addition, the assembly should meet the lead free requirement of Section 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the one month, all water services will be stopped till the assembly remains in compliance.</p>
