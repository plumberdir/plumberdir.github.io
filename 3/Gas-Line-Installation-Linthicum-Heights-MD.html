<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually typically been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due mostly to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to consumer misunderstandings about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening just gets rid of solidity minerals and eliminates problems that are a nuisance and not a danger to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not necessity. However, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>

<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
