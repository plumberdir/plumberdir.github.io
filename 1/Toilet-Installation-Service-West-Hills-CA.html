<p>Kitchen sinks are always susceptible to clogs with food and grease being the significant offenders. They harden to the piping walls if fats are poured down the sink. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls as well. Even tree roots can create major drain obstructions by wrapping around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water flow, requiring plumbers to discover and repair the issue for typical house plumbing operations. You need your drain cleaned up before it leads to additional damage and even more expensive repairs if this is what is happening to your house.</p>
