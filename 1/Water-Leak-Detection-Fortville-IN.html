When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the 2 metals.</p>
