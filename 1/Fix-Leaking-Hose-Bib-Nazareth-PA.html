<p>When you eliminate the cap to flush out the valve, inspect the washer for wear or fractures. Replacing a bad washer is cheap and easy. However discovering the best washer may not be. The most typical washers are typically readily available at home centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be difficult to find.
