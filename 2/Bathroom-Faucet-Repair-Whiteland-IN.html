<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
