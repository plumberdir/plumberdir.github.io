<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Ellijay GA 30540?</h3>
<p>Water temperature problems can be fixed by changing the temperature level on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be triggered by a blocked aerator screen. Homeowners can just unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clear out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way, water pressure can also be low.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the offender. However not constantly. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely. A chain with insufficient slack can cause problem too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack ideal.</p>
