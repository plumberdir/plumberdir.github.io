<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on pipes. Over an amount of time the within lining of the pipe will weaken and a small pinhole leak will establish. Often the solution is to repair the broken section of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is required to solve the problem. Other times a more substantial solution is required: repiping.</p>
