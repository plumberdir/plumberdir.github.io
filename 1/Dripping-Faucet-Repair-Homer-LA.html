Water softeners usually utilize salt (Na+) as the exchange ion. Sodium ions are provided from dissolved sodium chloride salt, also called salt water.

<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement.
