Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on.
