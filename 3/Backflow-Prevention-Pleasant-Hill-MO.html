<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Pleasant Hill MO</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually run valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automated valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and totally closed.</p>
<p>3. Think about a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning specialists are called into a house is because there is too much hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are quite cheap and easy to install, so there's no reason not to. When grease strengthens it sticks to the pipe and prevents water circulation, ultimately causing a backup. This added with other particles in your drain can cause a significant backup.</p>
