<p>Frequently caused by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then see and inspect if you see coloring in the bowl. This suggests a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is normally the fix. Alternatively, often a malfunctioning fill valve might activate intermittently, as well. Water won't drain or is draining gradually through the disposal.</p>
<p>Mechanical water softening systems are therefore also called ion exchange water softeners. The best way to clear a clogged drain without damaging your pipes and plumbing system is to contact a trusted local plumber at ABC.

The defected part will either spray or drip a lot, depending on the damage.</p>
