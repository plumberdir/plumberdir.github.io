<p>If you have an older home, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they start to wear away. This deterioration can result in an accumulation of lead, which can have lots of unfavorable impacts on your health. Corroded pipes also lead to bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
