<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
