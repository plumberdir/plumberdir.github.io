<p>If the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span, a guideline of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a brand-new burner package and the hot water heater is five years old, then it makes good sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself.

The factor is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>
