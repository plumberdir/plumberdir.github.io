<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a feasible solution, especially when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are lots of downsides to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they normally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your house and family.</p>
