<h3>Need An Emergency Plumber Campbell CA</h3>
<p>These guys were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had great reviews and a reasonable price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task tidying up after it too.</p>
<p>If the leaking water heater is inside of the house, it is nest to immediately run the water off to the heater and schedule a consultation with a plumber to avoid flooding within the house. Before we start any work, Accurate Leak and Line will prepare a schematic diagram that will map out the damage and the work needed to replace the pipe and supply a price quote of the cost of the replacement.</p>
