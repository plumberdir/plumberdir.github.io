Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.

A typical kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
