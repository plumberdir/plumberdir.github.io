<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical option is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to think about if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous years, but steel eventually struggles with corrosion and does not have the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
