<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check New London CT</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
