<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is normally the culprit. However not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely. A chain with too little slack can cause problem too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>Carefully listen and raise the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. If the water shuts down, you may have the ability to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no modification screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make sure it's adjusted correctly (Photo 8). You do not need to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
