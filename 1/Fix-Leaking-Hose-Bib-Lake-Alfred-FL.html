<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear.

<p>Chelation: Another method is to present a chemical compound that serves as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating representative and remain suspended in the water instead of building up on surfaces.
