<p>The source or location of a sewer problem identifies who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another.

<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a practical service, especially when easy plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are numerous disadvantages to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they normally consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, however at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your home and household.</p>
