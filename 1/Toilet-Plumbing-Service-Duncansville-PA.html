<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
