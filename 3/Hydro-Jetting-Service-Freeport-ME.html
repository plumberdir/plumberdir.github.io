These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your house and family.</p>
