<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
