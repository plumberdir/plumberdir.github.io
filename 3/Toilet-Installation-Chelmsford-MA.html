<h3>Clogged Drain Services in Chelmsford MA 01824</h3>
<p>Turn the manage counterclockwise if it becomes hard to turn; it's likely you have actually encountered a clog. Reverse the auger to pull it out of the drain and clear it of particles. Place it back into the drain until you hit resistance once again, then turn the handle back and forth to work some of the clog totally free. Pull the auger out occasionally to get rid of debris till it moves past the clog without resistance.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you think a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: spray a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After thirty minutes, examine to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has changed color. If it has, you probably have a leak.</p>
