<p>Water could be leaking onto the pilot burner flame. A leaking tank is a factor to call a water heater expert immediately. , if you regularly have backups make sure you have drain cleanouts to access your drain line quickly..

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a complete repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>
