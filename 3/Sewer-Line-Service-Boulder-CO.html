<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to dig up your yard. During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images recorded by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
