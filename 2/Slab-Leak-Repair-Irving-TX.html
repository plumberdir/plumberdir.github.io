<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently raise the rod and listen. You might be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Bend the float arm if there is no modification screw. Make sure it's changed appropriately (Photo 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not need to clear the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
