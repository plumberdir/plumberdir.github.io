<p>Aside from these 2 crucial components, there are a myriad of little, possibly less critical things that can break or degrade. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising effectively. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
