<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>

The majority of fire sprinkler heads, other than sprinkler heads on a deluge system are kept closed by a heat-sensitive operating mechanism. Typically, this operating mechanism is either a fusible link or a glass bulb.  Despite the operating system, only the sprinklers that are exposed to heat will open during a fire.</p>

For additional information, get in touch with the Well and Septic Department at (937) 225-4428. The well will need to be inspected if owner selects to abandon the well.
