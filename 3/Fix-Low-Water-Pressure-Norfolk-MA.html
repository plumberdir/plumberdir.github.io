<p>Newer models, such as tankless water heaters, are much more energy-efficient and can help you minimize your month-to-month utility expenses.

<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>If you see nothing obvious, insert the wrench into the motor spline, found at the bottom of the unit, and twist ideal and left.
