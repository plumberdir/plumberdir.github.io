<p>The typical solution is to have the faulty pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an option to think about if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many years, however steel ultimately experiences rust and lacks the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
