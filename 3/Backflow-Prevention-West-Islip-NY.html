The beads serve as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>
