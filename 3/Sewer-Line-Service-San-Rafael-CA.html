<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the public water supply and private on-site water supply and distribution systems by prohibiting cross-connections between safe and clean (appropriate for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by needing installation of main and secondary backflow prevention techniques. Secondary backflow approaches supply an increased level of security for the public supply of water system.</p>

<h3>Water Leak Detection Tips for Homes at San Rafael CA 94901</h3>
<p>If you've always lived in an area with difficult water, you might not recognize how much it affects you-- however if you've recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too knowledgeable about the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from hard water. Tough water hinders the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, causing you to use more. Hard water also makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that difficult water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden frequently.</p>
<p>Idea: Check with local codes prior to attempting to install a waste disposal unit. Some communities have plumbing codes that don't enable disposals because of limits on sewer capacity.
