<p>Your house's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>

Who you employ will also identify just how much you'll spend for a brand-new garbage disposal installation.</p>
