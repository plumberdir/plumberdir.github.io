Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while.

Much of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely damaging if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these items, please make sure to take the suitable safety measures.</p>
