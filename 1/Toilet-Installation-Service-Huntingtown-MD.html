<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and pricey plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire home repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 year old Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. It was a tough job since of the age of your home and location of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working prior to they left.
