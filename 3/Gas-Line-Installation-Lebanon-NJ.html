<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by eliminating hardness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that assist prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to hinder the scale from developing by neutralizing the hardness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener option in locations where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently remove hardness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
