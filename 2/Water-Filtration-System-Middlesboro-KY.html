Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>

Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet.
