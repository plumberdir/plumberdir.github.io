<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and pricey plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause an obstruction or can cause rust that obstructs the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Noise-- Over time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets hard and removes from the capacity of your water heater. This solidified sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
