<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
