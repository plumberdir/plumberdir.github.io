<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
