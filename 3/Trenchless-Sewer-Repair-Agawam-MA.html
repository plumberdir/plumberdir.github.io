<p>You live in an older house. There's an excellent possibility that you'll need to have it done soon if your house is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to burst and wear away when they get old.

This usually includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to know what the field test data indicates for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
