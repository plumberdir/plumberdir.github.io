<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Dowagiac MI</h3>
<p>These men were remarkable! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for many years now. It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had terrific evaluations and a reasonable rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it also.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
