<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
