Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity.

A common kind of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
