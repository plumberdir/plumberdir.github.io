<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
