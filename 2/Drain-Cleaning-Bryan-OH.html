<p>You can utilize a wire coat hanger by straightening it if you do not have a plumber's snake. Naturally, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it may be long enough to reach some clogs.

<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads end up being full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
