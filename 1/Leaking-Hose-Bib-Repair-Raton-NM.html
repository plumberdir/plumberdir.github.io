<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Guarantees? Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regeneration). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the highly concentrated saltwater service (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with salt or potassium ions.</p>
