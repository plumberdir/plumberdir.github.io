<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are checked for leaks or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them changed right away. Before you can request an inspection, you should initially get the required license( s) for the work you mean to do. You can check out our License page for more information on acquiring a permit. As soon as you get a license you can commence with the work. However, you should call for inspection before you conceal any work or cover.</p>

<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features 2 stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind against a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
