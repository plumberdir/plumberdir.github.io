<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, which makes its plumbing's efficient operating a need more than a need. When the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on extremely gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to make sure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close correctly when re-pressurized.

We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits a detailed cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line. The special nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to allow the water to cover the whole diameter of the sewer line and provide a mindful cleaning.</p>
