<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both.

Reductions in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

<p>One common method for a house's water supply to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which might end up being polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. The problem could spread tremendously if that infected water were to backflow into the community drinking supply.
