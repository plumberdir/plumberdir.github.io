<p>Galvanized metal, is simply a simpler method of saying zinc layered" and what triggers galvanized pipes to wear away is the exposure to too much water and minerals. You might be thinking that it does not make good sense to utilize a pipe that responds with water as your home's main source of water transport, and you would be right. Nevertheless, when the majority of these pipes were being installed, nobody knew this was going to be the result. Thankfully, there are a lot of other piping options nowadays including copper.</p>
