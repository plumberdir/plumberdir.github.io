<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>Water supplied by the water company consists of some amounts of damaging chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems eliminate these impurities to make drinking water clean, clear and tastier. As such, water filtration systems are necessary requirements, not optional expenses.
