<p>Because it can spread contaminated water back through a circulation system, Backflow is a prospective problem in a water system. For example, backflow at unrestrained cross connections (cross-connections are any potential or actual connection between the general public water system and a source of contamination or pollution) can enable contaminants or toxins to go into the safe and clean water system. Sickness can result from consuming water that has been infected due to backflow.</p>
