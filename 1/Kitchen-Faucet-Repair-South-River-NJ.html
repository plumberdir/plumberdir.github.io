<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely vital part of the design of each element. If the part is not fixed effectively, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of direct or constant) of the element, which could trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
