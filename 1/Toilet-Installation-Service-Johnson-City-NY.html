<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Johnson City NY</h3>
<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
