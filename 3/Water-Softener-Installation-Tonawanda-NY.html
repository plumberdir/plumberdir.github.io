<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We suggest organic items, such as Bio-Clean, due to the fact that they work much better than products including extreme chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or components.</p>
