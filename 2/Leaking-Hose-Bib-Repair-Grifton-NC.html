<p>The program achieves its mission by attending to the adoption and promulgation of appropriate rules and regulations for the construction of plumbing centers where mandated. Cold showers? High energy expenses? It may be time for a new warm water heater. But in order to reap the benefits of a new energy-efficient home appliance, you'll need to have it set up correctly. A water heater that is not set up correctly can lead to water damage, scalding temperature levels, or even a fire. That's why installation is best delegated professional plumbers who know the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
