<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Elmwood Park IL</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had terrific reviews and a reasonable rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
