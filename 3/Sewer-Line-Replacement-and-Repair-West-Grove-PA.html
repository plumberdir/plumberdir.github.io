<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a fantastic man. He informed me exactly what to expect (cost, time, process) up front and delivered as guaranteed. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay may be greater.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any irreversible or short-lived connection in between a public water system or customer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system including nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>Kitchen sinks are always susceptible to blockages with food and grease being the major perpetrators. They congeal to the piping walls if fats are put down the sink. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, attaching to the walls also. Even tree roots can create major drain clogs by twisting around pipes. Their squashing strength stops the water circulation, forcing plumbers to repair the issue and find for regular home plumbing operations. If this is what is happening to your house, you need your drain cleaned up before it leads to more damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
