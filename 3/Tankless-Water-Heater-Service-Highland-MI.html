Galvanized pipes were most often set up in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to corrode and burst when they get old. You may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one if so. This normally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
