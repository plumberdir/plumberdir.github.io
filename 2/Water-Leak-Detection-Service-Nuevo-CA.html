<p>Any location water runs through house. This consists of sinks, toilets, tubs, lines, and pipes. At this time, the pro will look for leaks and damaged pipes or fittings. With toilets, the pro will examine water levels, flappers, and filler systems. She or he will eyeball visible pipes, and might run a camera inspection to check the pipes' condition from the within.</p>
<p>Water system by the water company contains some amounts of damaging chemicals like arsenic and lead.
