<p>If you have actually always lived in an area with tough water, you might not understand how much it impacts you-- however if you have actually recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too aware of the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from hard water. Difficult water hinders the lathering of soaps and shampoos, causing you to use more. Difficult water likewise makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp.
