<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Waterloo NY</h3>
<p>These men were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had terrific reviews and a reasonable rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it too.</p>
