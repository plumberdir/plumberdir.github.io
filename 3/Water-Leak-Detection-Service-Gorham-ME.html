Inspecting the water meter is an excellent next action in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and examine if the water meter is turning. If it is, there is a leak somewhere and this might be serious issue. Proceed to the valves. Start with the main shut down valve operation. When turned off, no faucet in the house must have water. This chooses every other turned off valve and their matching faucets. If whatever is working properly, you are off to an excellent start.</p>

<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
