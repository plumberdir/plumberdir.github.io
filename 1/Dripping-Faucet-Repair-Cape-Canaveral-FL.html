<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical kind of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
