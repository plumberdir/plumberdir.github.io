<h2>Tips To Hire Residential Plumbing Companies in Burlington</h2>

<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This deterioration, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and produces a water resistant membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>We use both metal and plastic pipes in our repiping process. Because it is long lasting and resilient, copper is the industry standard. We will use you various choices based upon your budget and choices. PEX piping is a brand-new option that is flexible, resistant to rust, and up to 75 percent cheaper than copper piping.</p>
