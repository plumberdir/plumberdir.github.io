While repairs can fix a leak, it's typically much better to buy a new toilet. A leak can go undetected, triggering damage to your subfloor. If you need toilet repairs or are aiming to install a new system, call 415-441-2255 and talk to Magic Plumbing. We can discover the service you're trying to find.</p>
