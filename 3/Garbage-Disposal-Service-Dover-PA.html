Like nearly whatever in life, there's a excellent and bad  side to both gas and electric water heaters.

It depends on point of view, and what you as a specific feel are the conveniences you and your family need a lot of.</p>
<p>On its own, gas is colorless and odorless. A lot of energy companies add a sulfur compound to natural gas, which is where the rotten egg odor comes from. That way, you can easily tell if you have a gas leak.

<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Examine spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
