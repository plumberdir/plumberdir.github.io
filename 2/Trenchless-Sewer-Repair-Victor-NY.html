As long as the food waste is sent out through the disposal at a sensible amount, there should be no concern in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a few food items you need to most likely not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee premises, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop obstructing is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to clean pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for several seconds after you are finished cleaning to ensure the drain is clear.</p>

<p>Letters are sent out to residential consumers with recognized backflow devices on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis. Turn the disposal system to align the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and then connect it. Relying on the existing trap configuration, you may need to replace some or all of the drain piping underneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>You reside in an older home. If your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never replaced its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to burst and rust when they get old. If so, you might need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not currently have one. This normally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>Though it's not constantly required, often the plumber might have to update or repair circuitry to power the new garbage disposal. This normally costs an additional $50 to $100+. The pilot burner may need to be relit, the gas line may be clogged or need repair. If the gas line is harmed, the flowers or plant life near the gas leak will be blemished or degraded.
