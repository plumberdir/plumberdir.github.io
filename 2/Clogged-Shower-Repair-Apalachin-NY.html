<p>Depending upon your scenario, your plumber may use one or a combination of piping product throughout your house repiping task. Copper is standard since it's lasting, can endure fires, and resists weather condition. Nevertheless, copper is challenging to install, which means higher labor costs. PEX or polyethylene pipes have the benefit of versatility, which suggests plumbers can bend the pipes getting rid of the need for joints, which saves money and time and lowers the risk of joint leaks.

Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
