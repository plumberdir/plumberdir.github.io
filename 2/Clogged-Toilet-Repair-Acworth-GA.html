<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
