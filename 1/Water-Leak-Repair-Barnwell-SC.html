<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on a fixed schedule and then return to service. These work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt since they regrow whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, usually restore after so many gallons of water have been softened. Such models are practical if you have a rising and falling water use schedule.</p>
