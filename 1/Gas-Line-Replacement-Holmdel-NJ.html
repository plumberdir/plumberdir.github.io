No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola includes a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke.

It is very important that the repair specialist understands the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
