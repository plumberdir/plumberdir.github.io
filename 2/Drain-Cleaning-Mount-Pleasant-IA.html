<p>Very seldom does any structural damage happen as the outcome of slab leak. A slab leak is normally spotted before it triggers any substantial damage.

Leaked water generally stays under the house and fills into the ground soil. This can potentially trigger a cavity if your house's foundation was not appropriately compressed.
