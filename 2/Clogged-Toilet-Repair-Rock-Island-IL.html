<p>With tankless electric heaters, water is heated up directly whenever it's needed. Tankless systems specifically use an element that warms up water when the tap is turned on. The water is continually heated as long as the tap remains on. The water stops being heated up if the tap is instantly changed off. The heating temperature level is typically pre-set to fit your choices and needs. Tankless electric water heaters use less power than standard water heaters because they just heat water when required.</p>
<p>Wet pipe systems are installed in locations where the ambient temperature level is kept at or above 40 Â° F. When a sprinkler is activated by heat from a fire, water streams right away from the sprinkler head. These systems have water in the pipe at all times. In situations where there is a need to provide sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a little filling dock, an antifreeze system can be utilized. The addition of this chemical additive will need the installation of a high threat defense assembly.</p>
