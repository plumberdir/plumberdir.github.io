<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by getting rid of hardness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by neutralizing the solidity itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are often thought about a greener alternative in locations where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not successfully remove hardness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
