<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is important that the repair professional knows the appropriate installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. A lot of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
