<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not consist of blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes two stationary bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
