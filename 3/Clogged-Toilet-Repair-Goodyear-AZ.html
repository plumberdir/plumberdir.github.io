The repair might be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
