<p>You live in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never ever replaced its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were usually set up in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to rust and burst when they get old. If so, you may need to add a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you do not already have one. This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a fixed schedule and after that return to service. These work well for homes that are on regular water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt because they restore whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control designs, with either mechanical and electrical sensing units, typically regrow after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have an ever-changing water use schedule, such models are hassle-free.</p>
