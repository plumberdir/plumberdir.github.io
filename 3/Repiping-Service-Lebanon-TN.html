<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
