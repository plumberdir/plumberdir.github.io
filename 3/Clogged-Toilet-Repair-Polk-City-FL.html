It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had great reviews and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job tidying up after it too.</p>
