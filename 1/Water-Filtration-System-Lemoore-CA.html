<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the perpetrator. However not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger difficulty too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>The source or place of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (generally 10 feet large) where main drains pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>While pipe lining is a great alternative for many people, there are some scenarios where repiping is the only alternative. Repiping is the process of changing old rusty pipes with long-lasting and long lasting new pipes. The brand-new pipes that are used are generally made of copper since of their toughness and other elements. Repiping is primarily done on old pipes that were built in the '70s and made out of galvanized metals.</p>
