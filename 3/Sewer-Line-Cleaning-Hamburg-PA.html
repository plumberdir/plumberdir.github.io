<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, which makes its plumbing's efficient working a need more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to make sure no valves were inadvertently exposed or did not close properly when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
