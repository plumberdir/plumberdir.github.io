<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, that makes its plumbing's effective operating a necessity more than a need. When the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system ought to be examined to ensure no valves were accidentally exposed or did not close properly when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
