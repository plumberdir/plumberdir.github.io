Sediment Build-Up: If you observe strange popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your unit, this might be a sign that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is causing a response with the heating component. Lacking hot water rapidly is another sign of sediment build-up, because the sediment is taking up more space in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
