<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is used in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
