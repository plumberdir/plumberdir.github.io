<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical solution is to have the defective pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an option to think about if you live in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing.

<p>A guideline is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year lifespan. If, say, you need a brand-new burner package and the hot water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more skeptical the economics of a repair ends up being. The factor is that some other part on the appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
