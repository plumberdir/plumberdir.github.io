<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Erie PA</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
