<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.

When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
