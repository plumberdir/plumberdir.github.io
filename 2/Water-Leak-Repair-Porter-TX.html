<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania presently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for most building contractors (or their staff members). The key to the technology is being able to control both the crystal growth rate and their removal from our polymer beads, therefore removing solidity ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary technology officer.

Trenchless pipe repair is a form of pipe repair that does not involve any excavation.

The pipe lining process involves our group saturating a felt liner with a special resin mix. It is pressed through your pipeline when the felt liner is entirely filled. As the liner moves through your pipes, it coats the interior walls, sealing all fractures and flaws. If heat is utilized, the liner is left to harden in place for numerous hours or 60 minutes. Once the procedure is complete, the liner will be removed and your pipe will be examined one more time to ensure your new pipe is set within your existing one.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
