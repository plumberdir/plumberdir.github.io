<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and pricey plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a blockage or can trigger corrosion that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Noise-- Gradually sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets tough and removes from the capacity of your water heater. This hardened sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
