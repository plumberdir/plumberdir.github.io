<p>The pipe-bursting technique is used on pipes that are severely harmed, for changing an entire pipe system, or for fixing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to begin repair, that includes 2 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the gain access to point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe. As it makes its way through the system, breaking the old pipe apart and drawing in a brand-new seamless pipe behind it. The pipe is a plastic material that will be impervious to root intrusion for approximately 100 years.</p>
