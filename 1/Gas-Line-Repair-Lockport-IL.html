<p>If you discover low water pressure or tarnished water, it normally symbolizes rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals build up in time, they constrict the circulation of the water which is why you may notice lower water pressure. The discoloration happens when rust becomes loose from the pipes and flow into your water supply, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can end up being a health danger in your water.</p>
