Chicago Gas Lines focuses on natural gas installation and repair for fireplaces, fire pits, grills, home appliances, heaters, generators & gas lights. When no other source of a leak can be identified, it is safe to presume that it is the kitchen sink drain, or the kitchen sink faucet. For this leak, you will wish to loosen the drain, and clean it thoroughly. If it is set in place, eliminate all of the previous plumber's putty by utilizing a scraper.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Our professional plumbers provide preventive maintenance, plumbing repairs and emergency maintenance When you ask for a preventative maintenance service call, you can anticipate us to thoroughly examine your plumbing pipes for indications of leakages, deterioration and broken or malfunctioning water-using appliances, like toilets, showers, sinks and hot water heater. If our plumbers find any problems with your system, the problem will be discussed to you and the appropriate repairs will be suggested.</p>
