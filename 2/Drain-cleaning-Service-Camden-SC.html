<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement.

A PE or RA can assist identify if setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss.</p>
