<p>Against this, there is some anecdotal evidence that specific magnetic and electromagnetic devices can be efficient in preventing scale formation in tough water supply. It is really challenging to judge such claims, which are almost never ever based on tests that are well sufficient described to enable others to evaluate them and to confirm the outcomes. While the lack of "scientific" proof does not in itself invalidate a claim for the efficacy of a device, it should make one be reluctant to accept it without some warranty of efficiency.</p>

It might not work very well all the time, but you can't inform if that's normal or not. Plus, there's that omnipresent but never ever unacknowledged feeling that it's you-you're in some way doing something wrong in there.</p>
