<p>As a locally-owned business, integrity and duty are incredibly important to constructing a reputation for quality. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the drinkable water system within a structure these devices are known as isolation" BFP. Again, the best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air space, if there is no other way to provide one, then we check to see that the appropriate BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are required to be tested (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months afterwards.</p>
