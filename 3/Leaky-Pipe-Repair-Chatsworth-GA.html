<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for most building contractors (or their employees). The key to the innovation is being able to manage both the crystal growth rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thereby eliminating solidity ions and producing a water softening advantage that does not require replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," mentioned Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and chief innovation officer. This innovation is more cost reliable and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Throughout sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates professional inserts a high-resolution camera with a light connected to it into the sewer line at your residential or commercial property.

The details we glean from the inspection allows us to make an informed choice concerning the condition of your pipes and suggest the best solution as well. We can make the ideal recommendation with self-confidence if the pipe needs to be cleaned of blockages or relined with epoxy resin.</p>

Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
