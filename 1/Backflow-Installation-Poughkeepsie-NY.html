The age of your house is an important element to understand whether you must repipe your home. This is not only since your plumbing has actually aged with time, however likewise because homes that were built before a certain time period are most likely to consist of galvanized steel, known to be a metal that is obsolete on the planet of plumbing and beyond due to its level of sensitivity to rust. If your house was constructed prior to the 1970s, we highly recommend that you work with a plumbing professional to inspect your house's plumbing and examine if there are locations that need repiping.

<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.

When a trained tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
