<p>Likewise, if you have a 2-story home, it'll be more pricey to repipe because the plumber will have to browse through walls to do the job. Repiping plumbing lines in your house is a huge job - and it's a job you want to get right. But the range of plumbing pipe materials to select from can make it confusing. Here we look at some of the attributes of the significant pipe types to help you choose the best pipe for your plumbing.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
