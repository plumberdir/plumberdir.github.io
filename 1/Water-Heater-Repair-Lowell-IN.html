<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Lowell IN</h3>
<p>These people were incredible! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue off and on for several years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great task cleaning up after it too.</p>
