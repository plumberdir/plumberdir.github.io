In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly.
