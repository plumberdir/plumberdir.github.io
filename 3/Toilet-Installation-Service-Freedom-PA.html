<p>Turn the manage counterclockwise if it ends up being tough to turn; it's likely you've encountered an obstruction. Reverse the auger to pull it out of the drain and clear it of particles. Place it back into the drain up until you hit resistance once again, then turn the handle back and forth to work some of the clog totally free. Pull the auger out regularly to get rid of debris until it moves past the clog without resistance.</p>
<p>Clogged toilets are one of the most common plumbing issues plumbers deal with, and for many individuals, it's an emergency when the toilet is prepared to overflow. You can attempt to fix the clog yourself by utilizing a plunger, which you can purchase your local hardware shop.
