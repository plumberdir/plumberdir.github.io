<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, rust or collapsed pipes. Homeowners might have a video inspection done to discover the cause of regular sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>Water solidity is the quantity of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- difficult water is high in both calcium and magnesium.

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are set up in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
