Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>There are 2 broad categories of sources of potential cross contamination: internal and external.

<p>A cross-connection is any short-term or irreversible connection between a public water system or customer's potable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system including nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a means or mechanism to avoid backflow. The fundamental ways of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow.

The principal types of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly.</p>
