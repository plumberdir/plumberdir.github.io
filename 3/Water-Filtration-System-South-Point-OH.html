<p>However, you also need to think about the age of your unit. If your system is getting close to ten years old, it's normally not smart to pay for repairs if they are worth more than 50 percent of the rate of a new system. It is encouraged that you have the garbage disposal changed if problems become more regular with an older system. We offer a number of extremely effective and affordable systems, and supply in advance rates prior to work begins so there are no surprises.

Leaking water heaters can burst triggering water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
