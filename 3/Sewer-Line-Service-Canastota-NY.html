<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing set up during building of a brand-new or renovated structure is installed by educated artisans in accordance with relevant codes. Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the meals, or pour flat soda in your sink, you typically know your drain is clogged and requires cleaning.

<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium.

The tough water minerals are trapped in a trace and the softener amount of salt drains with the softened water.</p>
