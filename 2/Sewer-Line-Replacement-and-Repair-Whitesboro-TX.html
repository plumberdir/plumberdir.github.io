<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Services in Whitesboro</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the homes in our area were constructed before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became standard. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This rust, or rust, triggers the iron to swell up and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this accreditation. I've talked to a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing ranged from $150 - $250, but I would expect the rate to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
