<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most intricate and expensive plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. It was a challenging task since of the age of the house and location of the pipe. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
