<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and detailed plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole home repiping.

Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a gas line. Sound-- With time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment ultimately gets hard and eliminates from the capability of your water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
