<p>Replacing the old disposal with an identical brand-new one is less complicated than replacing with a various model. So, if you are not looking specifically for a various disposal this may be something to consider. A completely various disposal, or for installing your very first disposal, the sink port needs to be puttied into location. A safe and secure seal is a must. Once connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher connector is attached. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, making sure to connect wires accurately, and the base covered to secure the wiring from any water getting in.</p>
<p>Clear the trap: If the above techniques do not work, the next action would be to eliminate the P-trap under the sink. Place a pail underneath the area to capture water then unscrew the 2 threaded caps that hold the curved section of the pipe in location. Nowadays, many kitchen drains are made of white PVC pipe with connections that can be unscrewed by hand.</p>
