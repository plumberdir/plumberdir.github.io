Trenchless pipe repair is a type of pipe repair that does not involve any excavation.

<p>Remodeling plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200).

With this method, you know the turnkey rate going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
