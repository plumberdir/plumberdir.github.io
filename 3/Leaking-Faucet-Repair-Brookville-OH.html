<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on water pipes. Over a time period the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a small pinhole leak will develop. In some cases the service is to repair the broken area of pipe, and an area repair is all that is necessary to resolve the problem. Other times a more extensive service is required: repiping.</p>

We offer same-day service for toilet repair and installation with in advance prices and totally free estimates. Our specialists will check your toilet to identify if it can be fixed, discuss the work that is needed, and provide an estimate for the complete cost of the job.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
