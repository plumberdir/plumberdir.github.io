<p>In some cases, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
