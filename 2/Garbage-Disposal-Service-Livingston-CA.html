<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Livingston CA</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had fantastic evaluations and a fair rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it also.</p>
