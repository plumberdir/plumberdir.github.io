<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is really a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve offers an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
