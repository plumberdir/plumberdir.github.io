<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair service technician knows the appropriate installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. Most backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>

Upon arrival, a trusted professional will present their House Depot Company badge, and carry out the preliminary walkthrough to verify the scope of work.

This normally just takes a few hours, however if there are unexpected situations, your service provider might need to return the following day.</p>
