<p>One typical way for a house's supply of water to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which might end up being tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that contaminated water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply, the issue could spread out significantly. A backflow preventer not just secures drinking water in specific houses, it also prevents wastewater in private homes from flowing back out and polluting the general public water system.</p>
<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. These work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt because they restore whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, usually regenerate after numerous gallons of water have been softened. Such models are hassle-free if you have a changing water utilize schedule.</p>
