<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that permits water to go through it in one direction, but avoids it from going backwards in the opposite instructions. You have irreversible water hardness if you don't see limescale accumulation but rather see soap residue, your washing cleaning agents not working as efficiently or your skin getting scratchy and delicate. Do not try to find the leak if you smell gas. Instead, leave the house or building right away. Do not turn on or off any electrical switches, appliances, or lights, as an electrical charge might create a spark. Call the Peoples emergency hotline when you are in a safe place.</p>
<p>You may be lured to bond or patch a leak shut or replace just a single section of pipe to conserve money. While this might work in the short term, remember that the weakened pipe is made of the very same material as other pipes in your house, suggesting that trouble might be brewing elsewhere in your plumbing system.
