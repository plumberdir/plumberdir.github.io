<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to prevent winter season freezing. The brand-new pipe, made from a state-of-the-art, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls. Some drywall and wall product are gotten rid of to attach the pipes to the water fixtures, Wood says.
