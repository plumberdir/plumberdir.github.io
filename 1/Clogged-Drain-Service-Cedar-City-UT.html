Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
