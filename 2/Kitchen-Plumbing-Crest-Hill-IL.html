As seen on the above picture, there are numerous parts to a kitchen sink.

<p>When to repair: Toilet blockages are not uncommon, however if your toilet is blocking more than three times a month, there's a larger issue to examine. You might need to switch toilet paper or work with a plumber to clear a clog from the drain if your toilet is relatively brand-new. The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing company where you can look up your state's licensing information. Check the list of state licensing companies to find out whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List likewise preserves a licensing tool to check state licensing requirements.</p>
