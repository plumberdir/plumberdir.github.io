<h3>What To Do First When I Need An Emergency Plumber Near Me Newark DE</h3>
<p>These people were amazing! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had excellent reviews and a fair price, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job tidying up after it too.</p>
