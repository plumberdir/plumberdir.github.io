Like nearly whatever in life, there's a great and bad  side to both gas and electric water heaters. However, for example, just like the down side of lemons to some people is that they are sour, to others, that's an upside. It depends on perspective, and what you as an individual feel are the benefits you and your household need a lot of.</p>
<p>Is your house 50+ years old? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the main material utilized in plumbing. While galvanized steel is strong, it normally catches corrosion after about 50 years and needs replacement.
