When that takes place, water is no longer pressed forward into the home, allowing it to flow backward into city water materials.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the difficult water into the tank. The water permeates through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions.
