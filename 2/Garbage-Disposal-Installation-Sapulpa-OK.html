<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>The Plumbing Inspection Division is accountable for protecting the water supply by guaranteeing, through strategy review and inspections, that the plumbing has no cross-connections or possibility of backflow. The plumbing inspectors are also responsible for making sure the waste plumbing is appropriately vented and trapped so the plumbing safely carries run out while causing no health issue.</p>
