<p>Hydro jetting is among many trenchless services readily available to you, accessible by means of North Georgia Inliner. Hydro jetting is making use of hot, extremely pressurized water through a secured hose and nozzle to clear any and all blockages.

<p>Do not utilize ground joint unions except directly at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the home appliance. Each place where you will have a gas device need to have a gas shutoff valve.
