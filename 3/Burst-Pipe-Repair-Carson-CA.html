<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. This big amount of trash does not need to enter the garbage can if it can quickly and quickly be dealt with through the sink. A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into small pieces that can traveling through the sewage pipes without restraining water flow. By installing a garbage disposal you are assisting the environment by saving the quantity of trash that gets sent out to land fills and other dumping locations. With a waste disposal unit the trash is handled through already existing water facilities.</p>
