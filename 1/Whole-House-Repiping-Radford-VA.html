<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when looking for a practical solution, specifically when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are numerous downsides to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they normally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
