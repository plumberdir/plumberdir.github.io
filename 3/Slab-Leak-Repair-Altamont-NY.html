<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
