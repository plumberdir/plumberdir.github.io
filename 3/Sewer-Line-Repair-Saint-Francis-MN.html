<p>It is not always due to obstructions that stem inside the home when drains are clogged. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also known as tree root intrusion. When tree roots begin to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to cause drain problems. The type of drain pipes already installed, such as cast iron, copper, plastic or clay, will identify the degree of the damage that tree roots can cause to a sewer line.</p>
<p>Many home owners install gas lines for gas ranges, furnaces, fireplaces or other gas operable devices in the home. Gas lines provide the natural energy source to the home safely. Gas lines need to fulfill particular specs to guarantee that there are no gas leaks that might be harmful to the inhabitants. The service technician must make sure that the pipes are designed to appropriately deliver gas to the home.</p>
