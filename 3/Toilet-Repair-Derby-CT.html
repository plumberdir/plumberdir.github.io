<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is necessary that the repair professional knows the appropriate installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly.

The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is important that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
