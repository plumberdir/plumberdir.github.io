<p>We have an inspection program to identify water sources and circumstances that need backflow prevention gadgets. For residential property, it is necessary for owners to signal the District if any changes are made, such as digging a brand-new well. For commercial residential or commercial property, the District evaluates the use of each brand-new tenant. If the present backflow is not up to District code, the correction should be made prior to water service is permitted. Cost for the device is covered by either the residential or commercial property or the occupant owner.</p>
