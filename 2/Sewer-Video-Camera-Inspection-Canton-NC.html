<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc created and constructed a smaller model that ran on the same principle but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains in addition to laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise built a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and included a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It can cleaning big commercial and community sewer pipes.

Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>

In circumstances where there is a need to offer sprinklers in an unheated area, such as a little loading dock, an antifreeze system can be utilized.
