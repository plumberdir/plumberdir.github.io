<p>Sewer lines have one important function: carry wastewater out of a house or building. Many folks replace their water heaters due to poor performance, complete failure or as a preventive step. If your hot water heater is more than ten years old, it's time to think of replacing it with a more efficient model. Water on the floor can indicate used parts. Your plumber may replace the tank-to-bowl connections, or the gasket around the floor hole. Compared to the everyday expenses and aggravations incurred by tough water, a water softener is ultimately a financial investment that will conserve you a substantial amount of cash. The cost of the water softener system is greatly exceeded by the cash and energy saved.</p>
