<p>Changing the old disposal with a similar brand-new one is less complex than replacing with a different model. So, if you are not looking particularly for a different disposal this might be something to consider.

Once connected at the sink drain, the dishwasher port is connected. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, making sure to link wires precisely, and the base covered to secure the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
