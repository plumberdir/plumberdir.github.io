<h3>Cheap And Reliable Plumbers Ellington CT</h3>
<p>These people were remarkable! They appeared early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for many years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company because they had great reviews and a reasonable price, and despite the fact that the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it also.</p>
<p>Sinks aren't as simple as they utilized to be. Nowadays, house owners can choose from a dizzying series of sinks for the kitchen, bath, damp bar, utility room, and more. In the bathroom, you might have a pedestal sink, a wall-mounted sink, a vanity sink, a self-rimming sink, an undermount sink, a console sink, or a vessel sink.
