<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and associated gadgets consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water system react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the standard structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and may fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is likewise a typical reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to find.</p>
