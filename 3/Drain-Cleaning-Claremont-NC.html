<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>A lot of softeners have actually a bypass built into the inlet and the outlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you need to supply some type of maintenance to it or even while you're working on installing it. If the softener you choose does not have a bypass, then it's wise to build one out of plumbing to bypass the devices in case you need to preserve the unit.</p>
