Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be heated up and readily available for use. Also, corrosion of the tank's elements can cause the tank to have a short life. Demand that a brand-new one be installed if the water heater is old or you see apparent indications of rust.</p>
