<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>

Depending on the seriousness of the circumstance, just one piece may need replacement, or the entire under-sink assembly must be removed and replaced. Elements involved consist of slip nut joints and washers, tubing leading from the sink, P-trap or S-trap assemblies and sink drain baskets. Improperly set up P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not protected by nut joints and washers, must be reconfigured.</p>
