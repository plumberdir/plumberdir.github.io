Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
