<p>Your house's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you pour down there will not go through.</p>
