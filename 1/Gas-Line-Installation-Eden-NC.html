<p>Examine the house's hot water heater You will be looking to see if it is big enough to accommodate your requirements (a household of 4 must have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the hot water heater's age. Inspect to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will mean that less water will be heated up and available for use. Also, deterioration of the tank's components can trigger the tank to have a brief life. If the hot water heater is old or you see obvious indications of rust, request that a brand-new one be set up.</p>
