<p>You can utilize a wire coat wall mount by straightening it if you do not have a plumber's snake. Of course, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, but it may be long enough to reach some obstructions. If you can reach it, insert it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. When the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
