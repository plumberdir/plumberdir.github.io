<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Guarantees? Water circulates in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). During this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
