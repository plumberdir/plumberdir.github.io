When the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system.

When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>

<p>Aside from these two important elements, there are a myriad of little, maybe less important things that can break or weaken. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part requires to be in good shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
