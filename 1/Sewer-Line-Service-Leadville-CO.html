<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
