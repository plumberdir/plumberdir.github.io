However while small drips ought to not be cause for concern, property owners need to keep an eye on the water heater leakages.

<p>Drawbacks to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heat pump is on top of the water heater. Likewise, hybrids require as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to record enough heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
