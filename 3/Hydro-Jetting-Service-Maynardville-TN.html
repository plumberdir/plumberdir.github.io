<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In Maynardville TN</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves must prevent backflow.

A basic manually operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if completely closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless most of the automatic valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
