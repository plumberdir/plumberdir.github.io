<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>There's a good possibility you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing the end of their life-span. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to rust. This rust can result in a buildup of lead, which can have many unfavorable effects on your health. Rusty pipes also cause bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
