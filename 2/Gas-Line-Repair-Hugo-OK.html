Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
