<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are rather popular with property owners in the area. He kept in mind that there are specific impurities that locals are dealing with and an RO can help alleviate those issues. Due to being mainly farming in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some property owners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of agricultural waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems remove around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally takes place in some soils and that too can be fixed with the ideal RO system.</p>

Plumbing inspections make sure that water systems in buildings are linked effectively, without any cross-connection to infect safe and clean water systems.
