Sediment Accumulation: If you observe weird popping, banging, or clanging sounds originating from your unit, this could be a sign that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating element. Lacking warm water quickly is another indication of sediment accumulation, due to the fact that the sediment is taking up more space in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
