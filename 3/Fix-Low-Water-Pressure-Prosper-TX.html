<p>Very seldom does any structural damage take place as the result of slab leak. A slab leak is normally found before it causes any significant damage. The water leak is generally the size of a pinhole. This little hole allows water to continuously leak out extremely slowly. Over time it can lead to a significant build of water. Leaked water normally remains under the house and saturates into the ground soil. This can potentially cause a cavity if your house's foundation was not effectively compressed. This is an uncommon occasion and in general, there is little concern over structural damage as the outcome of a slab leak.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully listen and raise the rod. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no change screw, bend the float arm. Make sure it's adjusted appropriately (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not need to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
