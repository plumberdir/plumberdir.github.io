<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Chevy Chase MD</h3>
<p>Old, worn, or damaged plumbing pipes can cause substantial problems. Even small leakages can slowly dampen walls and floorings up until they become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other irritants. Old galvanized iron pipes might become corroded and add rust to the water supply. Gurgling noise from pipes. A strange, gurgling sound coming from the toilet whenever you flush or from the bathtub drain after you took a bath is never an excellent sign. Possibilities are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger may not be enough to resolve this problem. Call a plumber instantly.</p>
