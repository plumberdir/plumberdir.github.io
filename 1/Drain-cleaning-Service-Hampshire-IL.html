<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
<p>Plumbing is a vital part of your house or organisation, and its ability to function is essential.

Small clogs can become huge ones relatively rapidly.</p>
