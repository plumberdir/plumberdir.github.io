<h2>Tips To Hire Residential Plumbing Company in Wallington</h2>

<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older houses were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that is available in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This rust, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a water resistant membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>

While this may work in the short-term, remember that the weakened pipe is made of the very same product as other pipes in your house, suggesting that difficulty could be brewing elsewhere in your plumbing system.
