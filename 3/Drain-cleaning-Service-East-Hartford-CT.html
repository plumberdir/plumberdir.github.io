<p>Damage control is a problem. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I encounter situations, on a regular basis that require a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the job. Sometimes, the basements are so filled with sewage, I can not securely operate and get in the basement up until the sewage is drawn out and the basement is generally cleaned up. I 'd like to post some photos of this. Just look on line. The issue does exist.</p>
