<p>Changing the old disposal with a similar new one is less complex than replacing with a different design. So, if you are not looking particularly for a different disposal this might be something to think about.

Once linked at the sink drain, the dishwasher adapter is connected. The last thing is to wire up the new disposal, taking care to connect wires accurately, and the base covered to protect the electrical wiring from any water getting in.</p>
