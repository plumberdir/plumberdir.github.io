<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
