It is necessary to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt an effectively functioning RPZ assembly to periodically discharge small amounts of water.
