The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) suggests switching to one of the other two types of salts if this stain is an inconvenience in your house. When the brand-new salt has actually had a chance to completely replace the solar salt in your system, then acquire some water softener filter cleaner to clear out your softener as advised in your owner's handbook or on the cleaner label.</p>
