<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and eliminate water particles from the solution with hardness ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water particles for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is without solidity ions with no other ions being included. Membranes are a kind of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
