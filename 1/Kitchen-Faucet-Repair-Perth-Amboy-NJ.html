As soon as your plumber has installed a gas line, you'll desire an audit of the plumbing and installation to make sure that there are no gas leakages. This should be done prior to the plumber leaves the task. The audit will reduce the possibilities of a gas leak. Shut off the gas valves immediately if you do observe a pungent smell in your house after your plumber leaves. Evacuate the building and ensure that open fire does not get near your home until a professional can fix the gas leak. Contact your gas energy company immediately.</p>
<p>When a natural gas line is burst, it immediately becomes a severe security risk.
