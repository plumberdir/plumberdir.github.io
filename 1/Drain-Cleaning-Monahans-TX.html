If you are not certain of your repair capabilities, it is best to take your automobile to a certified mechanic.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: spray a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour.
