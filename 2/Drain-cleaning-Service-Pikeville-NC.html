<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The specialist turned off the water system and loosened up the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor. He was then able to get rid of the pipe to clear the clog and reattach the pipe to the toilet component. The client helped our specialist in moving the toilet back into its correct area, and the professional tightened up the bolts before restoring the supply of water and guaranteeing that the toilet was effectively flushing.</p>
