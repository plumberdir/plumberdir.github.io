<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on water pipes. Over an amount of time the inside lining of the pipe will degrade and a little pinhole leak will establish. Sometimes the service is to repair the damaged area of pipe, and an area repair is all that is needed to resolve the issue. Other times a more substantial service is required: repiping.</p>
<p>Other than for domestic pump and pump and irrigation systems, accreditation is not required to install plumbing systems beyond a building (e.g., water lines connected directly to community water pipe, sewer line connections, etc.). For excellent quality repiping services in your area, trust the group that puts their customers initially. Are you fighting with a drain concern?
