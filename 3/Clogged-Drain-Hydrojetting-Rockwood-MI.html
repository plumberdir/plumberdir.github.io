<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
