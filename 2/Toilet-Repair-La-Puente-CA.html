<p>In this scenario, dirty water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You also need to purchase a backflow valve if you see your water has an uncommon circulation, smell, taste or color. A plumbing professional can determine whether the issue with your faucet is a quick fix or the outcome of other concerns in your home's plumbing system. More complex issues with water temperature level or pressure may need changing the water heater, which typically costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capacity and type.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham inspects backflow assemblies upon installation and carries out periodic re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies must be checked by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report need to be provided to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste much better. The minerals in hard water can cause a bad odor and taste. When you include a water softener, it removes the mineral content to produce odor-free drinking water that tastes excellent.</p>
