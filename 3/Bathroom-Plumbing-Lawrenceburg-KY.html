The factor it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is since if the very first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an additional layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
