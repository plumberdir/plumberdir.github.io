Wastewater is Flooding Your Sink - A flooding sink is the stock-image for clogged drains. When your sink is filling with water after you clean your hands, clean the dishes, or put flat soda in your sink, you generally understand your drain is clogged and requires cleaning. However, when a clogged drain emerges through flooding, the clog is more than likely in the draining component itself. Clogs in a component can cause detrimental damage to your draining system the longer they persist.</p>
