<p>Downsides to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that remains between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heat pump is on top of the water heater. Also, hybrids require as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to capture adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
