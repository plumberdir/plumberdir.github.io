<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair King George VA</h3>
<p>Versus this, there is some anecdotal proof that certain magnetic and electro-magnetic gadgets can be effective in preventing scale formation in hard water systems. It is very difficult to judge such claims, which are almost never based on tests that are well adequate explained to enable others to evaluate them and to verify the outcomes. While the absence of "scientific" evidence does not in itself invalidate a claim for the effectiveness of a device, it should make one hesitate to accept it without some warranty of performance.</p>
<p>The cost to replace pipes under your house is merely the cost to install a brand-new plumbing system which can vary from $2,000 to $15,000 or more. You can install brand-new copper pipes for $3 to $8 per linear foot, or $0.40 to $0.50 per linear foot for PEX hose. Pipes do run under houses, sometimes in concrete. It is quite common to leave the old pipes in place after detaching them. The new pipe is just installed in the path of least resistance. Depending upon the design of your house, the pipe can be installed in the attic or under a crawl space.</p>
