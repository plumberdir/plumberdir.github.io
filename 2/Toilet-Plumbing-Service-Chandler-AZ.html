Difficult water disrupts the lathering of soaps and shampoos, causing you to utilize more. Difficult water also makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp.

Lastly, water containing the hard minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
