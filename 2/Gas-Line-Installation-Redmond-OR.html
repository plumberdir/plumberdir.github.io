<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components may have really tight tolerances that need to be maintained. An essential thing to determine on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the element. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each element. If the element is not fixed effectively, the guide might limit the motion (instead of direct or stable) of the component, which could cause the part to not work to its abilities.

Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
