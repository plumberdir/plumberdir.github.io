Consisted of in the job was an 800-square-foot commercial kitchen where Stegle's staff installed a triple-compartment sink, a hand sink and commercial dishwasher.

<p>Backsiphonage can happen when there is a sudden reduction in the water pressure of the distribution system, such as throughout fire fighting or when a water pipe breaks. At these occurances, water circulation can be reversed. This reversal can create a suction effect and draw possible impurities into the drinkable (drinking) water supply. Tank water heaters are typically found in the majority of homes. Their components are an insulated tank, usually holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and shop the water up until it's needed. A pipe emerges from the top to provide hot water to its destination, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
