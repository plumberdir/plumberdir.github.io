Discolored water signifies rust in your pipes or hot water heater. If your water is an uncommon color, this warrants professional attention.

The size of the pipes ought to be proportional to the size of the home appliance being installed.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing should be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this accreditation. I have actually contacted a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the rate to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
