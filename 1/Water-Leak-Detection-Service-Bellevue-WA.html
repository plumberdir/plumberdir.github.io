<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Whether you have a garbage disposal and it's not working properly, or if it's finally time to install one in your home, a waste disposal unit is a former luxury that is practically a requirement in these times. Always continue to run water during and after using your disposal. Ideally, flushing it with cold water for 30 seconds after the waste has vanished down the drain.</p>
<p>Drawbacks to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Also, hybrids need as much as 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to capture enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
