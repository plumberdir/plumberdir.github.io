<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
<p>Have non-testable" backflow devices changed at the intervals explained above. Have testable" backflow assemblies checked yearly and rebuilt or changed as required (generally every 5-8 years).
