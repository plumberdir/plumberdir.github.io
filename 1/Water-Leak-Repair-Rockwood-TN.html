<p>Gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is used for heating our homes, for lightening our stoves, and for running devices such as water heaters. This gas is made of a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially referred to as marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally happening gas that happens in the earth's crust and is also often formed by the decomposing of organic matters like sewage or manure. As beneficial as this gas is, the features that make this gas hazardous is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a silent killer. However, to thwart off that threat, mercaptans are added into gas, which offers it a rotten egg odor and makes it detectable when leaking. Ensure to only rely on an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
