<p>Video cameras are one of the most important tools in the plumbing business. When looking for a brand-new flapper, your best option is to try and discover the very same flapper that initially came with your existing flush valve. The easiest way to do that is by searching for your toilet model and selecting the flapper recommended for that model. If you do not understand your design number, however, we do offer an extensive selection of "will fit" flappers to help you out. Enjoy the video below to get more information about the different kinds of flappers offered, or visit How To Replace Toilet Flappers for brief tutorials on altering toilet flappers, tank balls, and flush valve seals.</p>

Blanc also developed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be towed by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and community sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable television. It was terminated in 1973.</p>

If you have a battle drain setup, it typically takes up your kitchen sink drain but can be set up on simply one side.</p>
