In addition, your contractor understands the dead giveaways of quality work that you may miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, correctly sized holes in floorings, joists, and studs. Finally, a quality contractor will not risk dealing with a substandard plumber. A basic error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily devastate $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floorings and make complex the task with insurance coverage claims, wasted time, and suits.
