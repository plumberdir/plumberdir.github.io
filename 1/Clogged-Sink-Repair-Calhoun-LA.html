<p>In some cases, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
