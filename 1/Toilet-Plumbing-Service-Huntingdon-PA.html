<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Toilet flush handles are another part of a toilet that can cause toilets to keep running. Typically handles are toilet parts that get loose or corroded and no longer pull the flap up or drop it back down properly. It's a simple repair, however there's a trick to getting the flush deal with out. The keeping nut inside the tank is a reverse thread. So, if you're in front of the toilet, turn the nut to the left to loosen up (Picture 1). Then get rid of the old deal with and lever, slide the new deal with into place, and thread on the keeping nut. Tighten by turning to the right (Photo 2).</p>
