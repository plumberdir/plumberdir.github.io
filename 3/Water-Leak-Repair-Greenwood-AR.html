<p>The source or place of a sewer problem determines who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The property owner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (usually 10 feet large) where main sewage systems traverse personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>

Another risk in sewer repair jobs is the collapse of earth from the walls around the dig site. Your security and health are too crucial to risk in a DIY sewer project! Prevent these security dangers by hiring a professional plumber.</p>
