Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is produced since of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
