<p>You live in an older house. If your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever changed its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to burst and wear away when they get old. If so, you may need to include a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you do not already have one. This usually adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>For example, a plumber on a forum sponsored by tool producer Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of clearing out a sewer line with a cable television and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done independently. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut begin at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for approximately 2 hours and $175 per hour for each extra hour.</p>
