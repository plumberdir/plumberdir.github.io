<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when searching for a feasible solution, especially when basic plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many downsides to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they typically consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your house and household.</p>
