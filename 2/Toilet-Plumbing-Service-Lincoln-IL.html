Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 years of age Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the home and place of the pipe, it was a hard task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working prior to they left.

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are set up in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane hangars.

If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then permits water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
