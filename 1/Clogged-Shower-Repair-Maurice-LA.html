<p>Before the repair service technician begins the repair process, he should be sure he has actually assessed the work area around the backflow prevention assembly in order to determine any limiting conditions. Correct security precautions should be followed for appropriate entry if the area is considered a restricted area. A correct and safe  work environment might require the placement of safety barriers or entry limitations around the workspace so the repair service technician or the public around your work area are not harmed.

<p>Template-Assisted Condensation: Reduced to TAC, this approach uses resin beads as a catalytic nucleation site where solidity mineral ions are changed into a steady crystalline form that will not hold on to surfaces. These crystals are microscopic and flow normally through the water. Unlike with a softener that utilizes ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not require continuous regrowth.</p>
