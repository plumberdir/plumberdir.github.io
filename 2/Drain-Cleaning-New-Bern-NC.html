<p>Whether a water system is identified "soft" or "difficult" depends on the presence of two extremely soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health viewpoint, these minerals have no negative impacts and are, in fact, necessary day-to-day nutrients. It is minerals that offer water the revitalizing flavor many people discover desirable. Nevertheless, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they buildup on contact surface areas, possibly plug pipes and damage hot water heater, and decrease the effectiveness of soaps and cleaning agents. At this point the water is said to be tough.</p>
