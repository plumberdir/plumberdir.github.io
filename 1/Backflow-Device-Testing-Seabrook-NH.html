The system selected for an offered installation should be proper for the system design and website conditions, including factor to consider of whether back siphoning or backpressure is most likely to happen. Even more, it needs to be set up in accordance with plumbing codes, producer specifications, and engineering guidelines for the kind of unit to be used.</p>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

<p>In the meantime, nevertheless, we suggest you first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. Many of these cleaners contain concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely damaging if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these items, please make sure to take the proper preventative measures.</p>
