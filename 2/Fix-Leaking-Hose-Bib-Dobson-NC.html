<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and remove water molecules from the solution with hardness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water system is devoid of hardness ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
<p>If you have your water tested, the report will use one or both of these systems to inform you how hard your water is. Given that the level of calcium carbonate indicates little to water customers, water specialists have categorized levels of firmness. Table 1 shows these categories.
