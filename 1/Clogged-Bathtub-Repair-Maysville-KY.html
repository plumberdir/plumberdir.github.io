<p>Agilent's series of leak detection solutions ensure the safety, security and consistent performance of research, vacuum, and commercial process systems. Examining the water meter is a terrific next action in your plumbing inspection. If the water meter is turning, close all faucets and check. There is a leak somewhere and this might be serious issue if it is. Carry on to the valves. Start with the main shut off valve operation. When shut off, no faucet in the house should have water. This goes for every other shut off valve and their matching faucets. You are off to an excellent start if whatever is working appropriately.</p>
