<p>Double Check Valve (DCV) - safe for usage both inside and underground, DCVs are a little bit more costly however are also extremely practical, as they can be set up horizontally or vertically. Video cameras work in locating buried septic tanks or examining the condition of buried pipes to determine correct maintenance schedules or the extent of required repairs.
