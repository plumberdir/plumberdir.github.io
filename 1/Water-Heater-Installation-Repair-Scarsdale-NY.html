<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Scarsdale NY</h3>
<p>These people were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it too.</p>

<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are looked for leaks or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them replaced right away. Before you can request an inspection, you need to first acquire the required authorization( s) for the work you plan to do. You can have a look at our Permit page for more details on getting an authorization. As soon as you acquire an authorization you can commence with the work. Nevertheless, you must call for inspection before you cover or hide any work.</p>
