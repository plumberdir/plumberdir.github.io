They also have vehicle settings such as trip modes that increases energy performance. These "solidity ions" trigger two major type of problems. First, the metal cations react with soaps, causing them to form an unpleasant precipitate-- the familiar "bathtub ring".</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you think a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: spray a couple of drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, examine to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually changed color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
<p>Often caused by sluggish seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a few drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then examine and see if you see coloring in the bowl. This suggests a leaky flapper valve. Replacement is usually the fix. Alternatively, in some cases a malfunctioning fill valve may activate intermittently, also.
