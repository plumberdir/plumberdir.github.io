The pipe is normally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Regularly, it goes into the home near the hot water heater. Your main shut off is attached to completion of the water pipe. Ensure you examine both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe gets in the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
