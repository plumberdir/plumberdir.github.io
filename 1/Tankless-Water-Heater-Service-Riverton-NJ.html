Check for leakages under the sink to validate that your plumber's putty is making a good seal. Remove the drain stopper, and enable the drain and P-trap to fill with water.

<p>Drains clog for a factor, however it's not always obvious. It is highly advised that a professional plumber perform a camera inspection on a main sewer line after it has actually clogged. This is twice as essential if you're purchasing a house. Think of in the above situation knowing the condition of the line prior to the purchase of a home. You can't constantly be specific whether the house has actually had drainage problems, and if so, whether the previous property owner knew the factor for the clog An easy camera inspection could make you knowledgeable about a very expensive and surprise problem prior to the purchase.</p>
