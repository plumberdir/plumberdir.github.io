<p>Filtration in sink taps and fridge water dispensers improves water's taste, but its steep price tag makes it not practical as a household service.

A clogged sewer pipe could leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning scam.</p>

<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, iron, magnesium and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the hard water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>

The backflow prevention assembly must be taken apart and parts changed with initial factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly should be evaluated once again to be sure it was properly repaired.
