Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is produced since of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
