Grease: Never ever put grease, fats, or oils down your kitchen sink. Rather than removing, these products often congeal to form nasty obstructions, which you may need a plumber to get rid of.</p>
<p>Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is contributed to water, which causes the solidity ions to precipitate. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide need to be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH back down.
