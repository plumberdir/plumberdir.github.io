<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
