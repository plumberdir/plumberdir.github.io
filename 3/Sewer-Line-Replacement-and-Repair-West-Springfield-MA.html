<h3>Plumbing Company Serving West Springfield MA</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your structure requires a backflow preventer or multiple gadgets, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in incredibly rare cases where the structure is deemed to not posture a risk to the water supply, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the homeowner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
