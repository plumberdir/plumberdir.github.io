<h3>Safe Alternatives In Fixing A Blocked Drain in Fenton MO 63026</h3>
<p>Strong sewage odor in your bathroom and other locations of your house. A sewage odor emanating from your bathroom or another area of your home can be an indicator of a serious issue with your plumbing. Pipes in your home may have burst or otherwise broken. If there is a persistent sewage smell in your house, it is important that you get in touch with a qualified plumber. Raw sewage is really unsafe and can present serious health risks.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>A garbage disposal lasts an average of 10 to 12 years. This typical lifespan calculation presumes normal wear and tear of the unit.
