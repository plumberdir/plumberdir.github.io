Cooking Grease: Cooking grease should never be thrown down the kitchen drain. While it may go down as a liquid, as it cools it can become strong, finish your pipes in the process. It still stays sticky, nevertheless, which permits it to draw in other debris, eventually developing a massive blockage in your pipes.</p>
<p>There's a great possibility you have galvanized pipes if you have an older house. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing completion of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to wear away. This rust can result in a buildup of lead, which can have many negative results on your health. Corroded pipes also cause poor water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, waste disposal unit do not contain blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes 2 stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk.
