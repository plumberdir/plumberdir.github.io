<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
