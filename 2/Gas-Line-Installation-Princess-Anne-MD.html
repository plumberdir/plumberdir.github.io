<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Princess Anne MD 21853?</h3>
<p>If you have actually always resided in an area with hard water, you may not recognize just how much it impacts you-- however if you have actually recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too aware of the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from hard water. Tough water interferes with the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, triggering you to use more. Hard water also makes it harder to clean soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that difficult water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden often.</p>
