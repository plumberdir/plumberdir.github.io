<p>When pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the potable system supplying the cosmetics water, backpressure is produced. This can force the drinkable water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Potential impurities can then go into the safe and clean water supply. The best way to reduce accumulation is have a professional flush it a minimum of once a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is specifically difficult with high mineral material, you may need to flush the water heater more often.</p>
