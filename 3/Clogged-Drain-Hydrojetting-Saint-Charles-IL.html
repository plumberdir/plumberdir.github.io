<p>Toilet repair tends to freak most people out a little, which is completely understandable. No one wants to unintentionally break something that could flood their bathroom with raw sewage. Nevertheless, most of toilet repairs are simple and easy tasks - such as changing a worn flapper - that the majority of people can do themselves in about 5 minutes.

<p>The next criteria to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is essential that the repair technician knows the proper installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly should be installed in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. A lot of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly only be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
