I've been to numerous carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having gone through the softener.

<p>Deluge systems are created so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems normally are installed in areas where the possibility of an extreme fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
