<h3>Helpful Tips For Choosing The Right Plumbing Service South Lake Tahoe CA</h3>
<p>Another common argument against the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The obvious problem with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic by hand run valve must stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  Nevertheless the majority of the automatic valves, such as the electric solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
<p>The drain valve (Picture 2) on old water heaters often clogs up. If the water drains gradually, be patient. CAUTION: It's scalding hot! IDEA: Turn your hot water heater off two hours in advance to permit the water to cool. The gas line contractors at S and J Plumbing are always ready to assist.
