<p>One common way for a house's supply of water to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which might end up being polluted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. If that infected water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the issue might spread out tremendously. A backflow preventer not only safeguards drinking water in private homes, it also prevents wastewater in private houses from receding out and infecting the public water system.</p>
<p>Do not utilize ground joint unions other than straight at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the home appliance.
