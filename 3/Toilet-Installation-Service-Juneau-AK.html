<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the tough water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
