<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on.
