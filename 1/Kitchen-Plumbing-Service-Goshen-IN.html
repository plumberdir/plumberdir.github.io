If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a garbage disposal includes 2 fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts require food and debris to grind versus a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
