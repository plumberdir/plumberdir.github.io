<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components might have very tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An important thing to identify on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is an extremely important part of the style of each component. If the part is not repaired appropriately, the guide could limit the motion (rather than direct or consistent) of the element, which could cause the component to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is required.</p>
