<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are developed to supply years of defense. There are many local conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as excessive pressure, water temperature, quality or turbidity can all cause the assembly to weaken in its efficiency. Some backflow prevention assemblies might rarely need repair while some are fixed on a regular basis. The test information from the field test will identify the repair frequency.</p>

<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve uses an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you test an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
