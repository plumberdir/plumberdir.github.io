<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the perpetrator. However not constantly. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper.

<p>You live in an older house. There's a good chance that you'll need to have it done soon if your house is 50 years old or older and you've never ever replaced its pipes.

You may need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't already have one if so. This normally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
