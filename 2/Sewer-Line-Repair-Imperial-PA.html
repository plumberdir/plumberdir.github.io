It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company since they had fantastic evaluations and a fair price, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great task cleaning up after it as well.</p>

The age of your home is a critical component to understand whether you need to repipe your home.

If your house was built prior to the 1970s, we highly encourage that you employ a plumbing professional to check your house's plumbing and check if there are locations that need repiping. Possibilities are that your house might need extensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can work at optimum rates if your home was constructed years before that.</p>
