<p>Without a plumbing camera inspection, the majority of drain problems can only be spotted once they begin to support. However, during routing plumbing inspections, a complete test of all drains will be carried out. Plumbers can attempt to recreate problems to figure out if something may be happening behind the walls or in the ground. Professional drain cleaning with cleanouts is far more effective at getting rid of blockages. Many houses have drain cleanouts, however, we come across older houses without cleanouts. A professional plumber can include cleanouts to your house if you are having drain problems.</p>
