<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself job.
