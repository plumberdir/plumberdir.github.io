<p>A. If you have rust spots, using phosphoric acid usually will help eliminate them. If you would like to try the gentlest technique possibly attempt using some Coke on the rust first.  No, we aren't kidding, Coca-Cola contains a trace amount of phosphoric acid. To try this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then soak some Coke. Wipe with a soft fabric and then more Coke, over and over, etc. Then use Naval Jelly which consists of a lot more phosphoric acid (be sure to check out the instructions and security cautions initially!), if that does not do the technique. Naval Jelly is what we here at Â® use to get rid of rust discolorations and it's readily available at most hardware shops.</p>
