<p>E.R. Services comprehends the importance of maintaining the integrity and performance of your kitchen. Sediment Accumulation: If you discover unusual popping, banging, or clanging sounds coming from your unit, this could be an indicator that sediment has built up in your tank, and is causing a response with the heating element. Running out of hot water quickly is another indication of sediment accumulation, because the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to weld or patch a leak shut or replace only a single area of pipe to conserve money. While this might work in the short term, remember that the weakened pipe is made of the same product as other pipes in your house, implying that trouble might be brewing elsewhere in your plumbing system. Repiping now will offer you assurance and prevent bigger leakages down the road.</p>

<p>Water softening utilizes a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>
