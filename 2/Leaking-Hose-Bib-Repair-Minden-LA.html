<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a fantastic guy. He informed me precisely what to anticipate (cost, time, process) in advance and provided as guaranteed. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the overall you pay may be greater.</p>
<p>A garbage disposal lasts approximately 10 to 12 years. This typical life-span estimation presumes normal wear and tear of the unit. The lifespan of a garbage disposal might be lower in the case of disregard, overuse, and abuse of the disposal unit. Time for a brand-new bathroom or kitchen sink installation? Have a drain connection or other issue that calls for a kitchen or bathroom sink repair? Our plumbing services are ready for both commercial and residential requirements-- utility room, cooking areas, and bathrooms in addition to a public lavatory, preparation, janitorial, and wash sinks.</p>
<p>It helps to know the brand name and design of your toilet. The trademark name is normally on the bowl behind the seat. In many cases, the design or number will be on the underside of the lid or inside the tank. Matching an unusual flapper can become an experimental process. Even professional plumbers in some cases try 2 or 3 flappers before they find one that works well.</p>
