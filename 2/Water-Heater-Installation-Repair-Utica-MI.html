<h3>Drain Pipe Repair in Utica Michigan</h2>

In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will advise a full repipe in specific communities, based on our experience.</p>
