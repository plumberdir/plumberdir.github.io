<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your house, that makes its plumbing's effective operating a requirement more than a need. When the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to guarantee no valves were accidentally left open or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
