Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the potable water system within a building these devices are referred to as isolation" BFP. Again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air gap, if there is no other way to offer one, then we inspect to see that the proper BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>
