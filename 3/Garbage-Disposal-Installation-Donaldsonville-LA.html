They normally utilize sulfuric acid or salt hydroxide to liquify gunky accumulation. While effective at eliminating obstructions, they could do your plumbing more damage than great. Here are 3 reasons to prevent pouring these harsh chemicals down your drain.</p>

A simple error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly ravage $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floorings and complicate the job with insurance claims, lost time, and suits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the very best.</p>
