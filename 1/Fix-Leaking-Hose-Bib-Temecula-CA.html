<p>So, what's a backflow prevention valve? This is a device that ensures non-potable water doesn't return into the main supply of water system. Basically, it's a device that ensures water flows in one direction. When you have a sewer problem, you'll desire the sewer repair process to reduce disruptions to your residential or commercial property or service.

<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
