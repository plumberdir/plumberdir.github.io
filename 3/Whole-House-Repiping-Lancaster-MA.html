Thomas & Galbraith Heating, Cooling & Plumbing offers repair and replacement services for water heaters in the Cincinnati, Ohio area, along with cities and towns in the surrounding city.

<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An important thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the element. The guide is a very important part of the design of each component. If the element is not repaired correctly, the guide might restrict the motion (instead of stable or direct) of the component, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Lot of times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
