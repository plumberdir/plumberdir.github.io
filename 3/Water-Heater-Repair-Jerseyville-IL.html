<p>E.R. Services comprehends the importance of keeping the stability and performance of your kitchen. Sediment Build-Up: If you notice strange popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your system, this might be an indication that sediment has built up in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating component. Running out of hot water quickly is another indication of sediment build-up, because the sediment is taking up more space in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
