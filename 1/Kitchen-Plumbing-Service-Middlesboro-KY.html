The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
